According to Wing (2006), computational thinking is a way of designing a system and understanding human behaviors by focusing on the basic concepts of the computer sciences. The recent focus on computational thinking as a key 21 st century skill for all students has led to a number of curriculum initiatives to embed it in K-12 classrooms and to introduce computing ideas to students early during their schooling years. The present study aims to explore the effects of a short, intensive coding and robotics training on the computational thinking skill self-efficacy of middle school students. 24 fifth graders participated in the study and data were collected by means of the Computational Thinking Self-efficacy scale (CTS) and one open-ended question.

Both quantitative and behavioral data were collected to understand the impact of rewards (power-up or customization) and competition (with or without) on students’ intrinsic motivation, game performance, behaviors, and CT skills. The findings uncovered significant interactions between rewards and competition. Students with both competition and power-up rewards achieved the highest game points but the lowest CT performance, whereas those exposed to the same power-up rewards without competition attained the lowest game points but the best CT performance.

This paper presents validity and reliability evidence of a performance-based assessment of CT using item response theory (IRT) from 272 children aged 4–8. Using a two-parameter logistic model IRT model (2PL IRT), we confirmed that model- and item-level fits are acceptable. Item analyses revealed a high discriminability (M = 2.26, SD = 1.12) and a moderate item difficulty (M = −0.21; SD = 0.86), on average, across 19 items. Reliability analysis demonstrated that the assessment was substantially reliable (marginal reliability: rxx = 0.87). Differential item functioning (DIF) analyses indicated that the assessment estimated children's item parameters fairly, regardless of their gender and age. However, we confirmed gaps in latent ability (θ) of CT by gender and age: boys showed higher latent ability of CT than girls, and old children (above 72 months) showed higher latent ability than young children (below 72 months). Findings suggest the assessment is a fair measure that can serve as a reliable and valid tool to assess CT for children who are emerging readers.",,", , , , "

Although CT has received wide attention since this concept was proposed, the current theoretical models have not well defined the complex relations between CT and other cognitive abilities for young children. To provide insight into this gap, the current study proposed a model in which we hypothesized that CT was significantly related to arithmetic fluency that is viewed as an important domain of mathematics. Additionally, arithmetic fluency was predicted to mediate the relations of CT to other cognitive abilities, including reasoning and creativity. This study tested such direct and indirect relations in children aged 5–6 years. Consistent with previous studies on older age groups, the results showed that CT and arithmetic fluency were significantly related to each other and both were significantly related to reasoning ability and creative thinking as well. Moreover, this study, for the first time, indicated that arithmetic fluency totally mediated the relation between CT and reasoning ability, suggesting that these concepts share conceptual commonalities, such as the cognitive processes related to mathematics or/and abstraction; in contrast, arithmetic fluency did not mediate the relation between CT and creative thinking, suggesting that gaining CT skill may exert direct positive effect on the development of creativity. Therefore, despite the root in computer science, CT is associated with many cognitive and learning abilities in other domains, supporting the importance of including CT into early school education.",,"Computational thinking, Arithmetic fluency, Reasoning ability, Creative thinking, Mediation effect"

Nonetheless, across all economies worldwide, there is a need to have more workers who are able to think through problems, challenges, and solutions in computational terms. It is thus of utmost importance to integrate the teaching of computational thinking in K-12 education in order to reduce the skills gap between education and the workplace. A pertinent and crucial question that arises is whether teachers have the knowledge and skills to teach students how to think computationally. Existing research shows that teacher education departments do not currently have the knowledge to promote computational thinking in their programs. The present study focuses on two aspects of computational thinking, such as, algorithmic thinking and debugging skills with the use of scaffolded programming scripts in an educational technology undergraduate course.

However, research gaps remain in understanding how SRL and CT interact from a developmental perspective. Our study designed a program with tailored animations and worksheets to specifically foster students' learning and cognitive development. Using a mixed-methods approach, we administered surveys among 1235 students from 29 Hong Kong primary schools to investigate a dynamic learning system comprising SRL and CT in a large-scale CT program. Additionally, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 15 students to further probe insights. Quantitative findings revealed a mutually reinforcing relationship in the dynamic system, suggesting that higher SRL skills enhance cognitive CT abilities, and vice versa. Complementing these results, qualitative findings showed that integrating animations and worksheets into the CT program significantly boosted students' SRL and cognitive development. These findings have significant implications for educational practices and curriculum design. Schools should consider implementing SRL strategies, such as proactive goal setting and reflective evaluation, within their curricula to promote students’ cognitive development. Furthermore, strategic investments in educational technology, including collaborations with EdTech developers, are essential to create effective, pedagogically sound tools that enhance learning outcomes. These insights provide valuable guidance for creating a supportive SRL environment that fosters cognitive development in primary school education.",,"Cognitive development, Computational thinking, Mixed methods design, Reciprocal dynamics, Self-regulated learning"

The study analysed teachers’ perceptions of integrating CT into school subjects through the constructionist approach, using Scratch a leading programming platform inspired by Resnick's Lifelong Kindergarten Constructionist model. Over a school year, 31 teachers participated in a professional development program and applied this model in their classrooms. The teachers were interviewed to capture their perceptions of learning and teaching using a constructionist method. The findings revealed that teachers with creative arts experience fully embraced the model, while others partially adopted it. Teachers recognized the benefits of constructionist teaching in fostering creativity, motivation, and engagement among students. However, they struggled with balancing these benefits with school demands and constraints. Challenges included managing time effectively within constraints of school and ensuring curriculum alignment. Despite this, many teachers found that the constructionist approach positively impacted students' learning engagement and personal development.

Our findings suggested that the effects of working memory varied in the interplay between CT and creativity due to differences in age range, neural network activation regions, and measurements. Intellectual abilities, including algorithmic fluency, reasoning ability, and coding ability, showed cognitive transfer effect on CT skills but not necessarily on creativity, suggesting that cognitive abilities embracing more intelligent elements may contribute to the functional connectivity in CT neural networks but only partly overlapped with creativity involved networks.

Nevertheless, a preliminary investigation revealed an apparent lack of understanding of computational thinking skills in general among teachers. The study explores the feasibility of developing a localized E-learning system to train computational thinking skills among teachers. An E-learning system, termed as myCTGWBL, was developed on the basis of a newly proposed conceptual framework to present computational thinking teaching–learning repertoire to the teachers. The hypothesis is that myCTGWBL would develop teachers' computational thinking and its position in teaching–learning understanding. myCTGWBL relevance was tested through DeLone and McLean's information system and Urbach's collaboration quality construct. To determine the success factors, partial least squares structural equation modeling was used. A total of 369 teachers participated in a two-stage survey. Participants' understanding of computational thinking and perceptions were recorded at the pre- and post-intervention phases. Open-ended questions of the surveys were analyzed using a simple text analysis technique. The closed-ended questions surveys were analyzed using SPSS Statistics 22.0. A significant improvement in teachers' computational thinking teaching–learning repertoire in a relatively short period has been recorded. Teachers also demonstrated increased confidence in the future delivering computational thinking-based lessons. The E-learning conceptual framework has illustrated the predictive power between user intent, user satisfaction, and Computational thinking (CT) knowledge benefits.

CT is a problem-solving skill that is crucial in the 21st century. CT may be used to support language education. Courses in English as a foreign language often need an effective writing component that includes writing organization and language use, as demonstrated by the poor writing samples often generated by students of these courses. To address the problems, CT, which is a higher-order mode of problem-solving and knowledge acquisition optimization, was used. The experimental group was instructed using the CT teaching model based on CT's essential components (decomposition, generalization, abstraction, algorithm, and evaluation), whereas the control group was taught using the conventional method. In total, 58 undergraduate students divided into two groups participated in this study. A combination of writing, CT skills, surveys, and interviews were used to collect data according to an experimental design. The collected quantitative data were analyzed through analysis of covariance and structural equation modeling, and the MAXQDA 2022software was used to analyze the collected qualitative data. The results of this study indicate that incorporating CT into an English writing course enhances the writing and higher-order thinking skills of students.

To address this knowledge gap, this systematic review examined 26 studies on the teaching and learning of computational thinking in early childhood education from 2010 to 2022. The content knowledge, tools, pedagogical design, assessment methods, and learning outcomes were analyzed. Results indicated that, with age-appropriate instructional design, children could develop early concepts and skills of computational thinking, as well as other related skills such as communication, collaboration, and problem solving. Across the studies, we found that most studies used quantitative research methods, with direct assessment and observation being the most. Several challenges were identified: (1) achieving a deeper learning of computational thinking; (2) a lack of valid and reliable computational thinking assessments for children with a wider age range; (3) selecting appropriate learning tools; and (4) designing age-appropriate activities for young learners. Although with these challenges, computational thinking education could bring new learning opportunities and enhance children's computational thinking skills, as well as other non-cognitive skills such as critical thinking, body-material interaction, and hand-eye coordination.

Latent profile analysis, which examines the interplay between variables to distinguish subgroups of individuals, has recently emerged in studies of computational thinking (CT) as a method for identifying student profiles. However, the latent profiles of CT teachers have not yet been analysed. We therefore analysed the latent profiles of a sample of 493 teachers who had participated in a teacher development programme in CT, according to their knowledge and perceived usefulness of CT. Three profiles were identified: (1) highly knowledgeable with high perceived usefulness, (2) knowledgeable with low perceived usefulness, and (3) less knowledgeable with low perceived usefulness. Qualitative data further triangulated these findings. We also examined the learning achievement of 12,105 students taught by these teachers. Students taught by highly knowledgeable teachers with a high perceived sense of usefulness demonstrated significantly better achievement than their peers. Our findings highlight the importance of nurturing both knowledge of and perceived usefulness in CT. They also provide valuable insights for similar teacher development programmes, emphasizing the importance of peer mentoring support for less knowledgeable teachers. Additionally, we underscore the value of having teachers create artefacts using CT for instructional purposes, allowing them to gain firsthand experience of its usefulness. As few studies have explored teachers' latent profiles based on the dimensions of knowledge and attitudes, the contribution of this study extends beyond the domain of CT.",,"Computational thinking, Latent profile analysis, Perceived usefulness, Student achievement, Teacher knowledge"

To solve the problem, the researchers conducted a pretest, interventionist group dynamic assessment (IGDA) in the form of negative feedback based on computational thinking (CT), higher-order thinking, and post-test quasi-experimental design, with a control group receiving the direct correction feedback instructing model to mitigate the NCT in EFL syntactic writing. We analyzed the syntactic writing types and frequencies of the NCT obtained through repeated-measure ANOVA and confirmed by qualitative data through video recording. The results indicated that IGDA in the form of negative feedback based on CT principal skills could (1) significantly decrease syntactic writing errors caused by the NCT, (2) improve learners’ EFL writing performance, and finally, (3) elevate the computer as an essential mediation tool. This innovative instructing mode of intervening with writing constructs and higher-order thinking and bringing about deeper thinking and creativity contributes to the EFL writing teaching methodology in a foreign language higher education.",,"Negative Chinese transfer, EFL syntactic writing, Computational thinking, Negative feedback, Interventionist group dynamic assessment"

To date, students' evaluations of teaching (SETs) have been the reigning mechanism for assessing effective teaching. However, prior work has shown that SETs are often biased against underrepresented groups and minorities. The present study analyzes options for effective teaching assessments, which include evaluating final grades and measuring the differences between students’ pre- and post-tests (normalized gain) using standard instruments. The content area and the instrument used in this study originated in the computational thinking field, which has a widespread presence in engineering, where minorities are at a disadvantage. This study obtained a total of 88 student participants from four sections of an introductory engineering course at a Southwestern institution. The study utilized a computational thinking diagnostic (CTD) to inform the course teaching approach (the intervention). Results show that (a) normalized learning gains correlated moderately with SETs, (b) final grades correlated strongly with SETs, (c) final grades correlated strongly with normalized learning gains, (d) the educational intervention based on the CTD significantly affected student learning, and (e) SET comments affect evaluations. The implications include the notion that standardized instrument-driven instruction and evaluations can increase the success of minorities on both sides of the classroom. The purpose of this manuscript is to invite the Heliyon readership to get involved in the development of related instruments and to incorporate these measures of learning into their instruction so biases are avoided or minimized.",,"Measures of teaching effectiveness, Computational thinking, Students' evaluations of teaching (SETs), Measures of learning, Biased faculty assessment"

The added value of using Scratch in the context of teacher education lies not only in familiarity with a programming language but with an emphasis on experiencing self-directed learning tackling with problem solving situations, creativity, socioemotional competencies, and logical computational thinking. The present study aims to examine 25 PSTs' attitudes towards facing challenges of coding with Scratch. To this end, a mixed-method approach was activated by using questionnaires, blog posts, and reflections. Findings revealed that the learning environment encouraged PSTs' use of abstraction and decomposition to address a complex problem or to design a complex game.

Also not widely explored is how teachers are to practice the CT core competencies during the learning process to cultivate students' problem-solving thinking. As the adoption of student-generated questions (SGQ) is an instructional strategy to promote higher-order thinking, we develop a GBL platform that uses this strategy to enhance students' CT skills, learning motivation, and learning confidence. For this purpose, fifty-three primary school students were recruited for this study, and data were collected during four classes of experimental CT activities. This study shows that the experimental group using the SGQ strategy with a GBL platform exhibited significantly higher CT skills than the control group. In addition, with respect to learning motivation and learning confidence it is found that the experimental group also outperformed the control group. This confirms that integrating the SGQ strategy and CT core competencies fosters higher-order cognitive thinking in students in problem-solving through gamification of the learning environment, resulting in higher motivation and confidence to complete experimental activities.",,"Computational thinking, Student-generated questions strategy, Game-based learning, Blocky game, Visual programming"

Our goal was to have a thorough understanding of the educational settings in which research on both CT and creativity was conducted, the theoretical foundations it has laid down, and the research tools used. Our findings indicate a geographical bias (dominance of the US and prominence of developed European countries), as well as a focus on secondary education and on STEM-related disciplines; this could be explained by the current situation of CT spread. We also found that when studying CT and creativity jointly, it is most common to define CT in a broader perspective than merely programming of computer science. Additionally, while creativity is largely referred to as product-related, CT is barely referred to as such. Taken together, our findings point out some gaps in the current research of CT and creativity and suggest how it should be expended on the fertile grounds of creativity, as the latter crosses geographical, age, and subject borders.

Scholars claim that CT for all should be ensured from an early age, and several studies develop and examine age-appropriate technological tools, as well as pedagogical approaches, for young children’s learning of CT. Based on 1.5 years of co-designing for children’s situated CT in two Danish kindergartens, the present study conducts a socioculturally informed analysis of video-observed interactions between children and educational robots. The findings display how children and robots engage in interactions that transcend children’s mastery of CT in any narrow sense. This is examined as situated enactments of CE; as children’s critical and informed decisions regarding the roles that technologies, in this case educational robots, can play in their institutionally situated social lives.

The research devised a series of unplugged activities, encompassing mathematical games, hands-on construction of mathematical logic boards, and calculating shopping discounts. The overarching objective was to investigate the impact of these unplugged activities on students’ mathematical creativity and CT. Students participating in a mathematics curriculum based on unplugged activities (N = 47) were compared with students participating in a traditional lecture-based mathematics curriculum (N = 46).

Aims This study aims to investigate potential self-worth threats as amplifiers of student teachers’ resistance to engage in computational thinking. Method 323 student teachers participated in the study. Participants filled out a questionnaire on expectancy of success and anxiety towards computational thinking, and rated how likely they were to engage in self-protective behaviours, i.e., self-handicapping, avoiding novelty, and academic cheating, when learning about computational thinking at the start of the semester. Results Students showed heightened levels of anxiety and low levels of expectancy towards computational thinking. Further, they reported that they would be likely to engage in self-protective behaviours. A structural equation model showed that anxiety towards computational thinking was positively related to self-protective behaviours. Moreover, expectancy had a negative indirect effect via anxiety towards computational thinking on self-protective behaviours.

In this context, the aim of this study is to develop an online, interactive, valid, reliable and useful performance-based assessment tool for measuring computational thinking skills. Data were collected in two stages with three different measurement tools. In the data collection phase, a psychometric scale, a skill test and an interactive web application developed in this study were used. In the study in which a total of 203 high school students participated, it was determined that the students' computational thinking skills were at average level. as a result, a valid and reliable performance-based platform was developed for measuring computational thinking skills. It has also been concluded that the performance-based measurement tool makes a better measurement than the psychometric scale. It is emphasized that computational thinking should be treated as a skill or group of skills, not as a theoretical knowledge, product/portfolio or attitude/perception. Therefore, it is believed that developing performance-based tools for evaluating computational thinking skills and measuring them by using multiple measurement tools will give more accurate results.

Yet, there is little empirical evidence that shows the relationship between CT and children's overall cognitive functioning. As such, this study explored the relationships between Chinese children's CT and their sequencing ability and self-regulation in early childhood. One hundred and one Chinese young children (Ngirl = 52 and Nboy = 49; Mage = 5.25, SD = 0.73) were recruited and evaluated with three reliable instruments. Hierarchical regression analyses indicated that: (1) CT positively predicted sequencing ability (β = 0.27, p < .05) even after controlling for relevant demographic covariates such as age, gender, and family socioeconomic status; (2) CT positively predicted self-regulation (β = 0.47, p < .001) after controlling for demographic covariates.

However, few solid empirical studies analyze the effects of the digital badges approach in CS education to develop students' CT. Therefore, to bridge this gap, this study designed and implemented a block-based programming course in a primary school and examined the impact of the digital badges approach on pupils' CT skills and self-efficacy and learning motivation in CS. A quasi-experimental design was conducted among 99 third-grade students across three classes. The results revealed that the adapted digital badges in primary school (1) significantly improved the students' CT skills, (2) had no significant positive impact on their CT self-efficacy or learning motivation in CS, and (3) showed no mediating effect of learning motivation on the relationship between CT skills and CT self-efficacy. In addition, we found that whether students could see only their own digital badges or also those of others had no impact on CT skills, self-efficacy, or learning motivation in CS.

Relational thinking was evidenced across a range of subtraction calculation skill levels. Those students who could use both indirect addition and take-away strategies flexibly, depending on the size of the numbers involved, were more likely to evidence attention to generality with symbolic equations.

Aspects of children's motivation can increase the likelihood that children approach computational thinking activities with enthusiasm and deep engagement. Gender inequities may interfere with children's readiness to take advantage of opportunities to build computational thinking skills through activities such as coding. Societal stereotypes can reduce young girls’ motivation to engage with computer science, preventing them from gaining benefits from coding activities designed to support computational thinking. This study examined children's gender stereotypes as well as children's own motivation for computer coding in 363 first- through third-grade children. We assessed gender differences in both stereotypes and motivation, as well as links between the stereotypes that individual children held and their own motivation. Children generally endorsed stereotypes about interest and ability for computer coding that favored their own-gender group, although third-grade girls reported gender-egalitarian beliefs about interest in coding. There were no gender differences in children's motivation for computer coding in terms of their own interest, sense of belonging, or ability self-concepts. Children's stereotypes about their own-gender group were significantly positively correlated with their own motivation for computer coding. These findings suggest that early childhood represents an excellent age for children to begin building computational thinking skills, before girls endorse negative stereotypes about their gender's interest in computer science.",,"Computational thinking, Motivation, Gender, Stereotypes, Belonging, Self-concepts"

After further screening, 26 peer-reviewed articles were selected. We synthesized the 33 effect sizes to assess the overall effectiveness of robot-supported learning on CT and its sub-dimensions: concepts, practices, and perspectives. Our findings revealed a medium effect of robot-supported learning on students' CT (g = 0.643), a large effect on CT concepts (g = 0.650), a medium effect on CT practices (g = 0.587), and a huge effect on CT perspectives (g = 1.419). We also explored the moderators (i.e., grade level, study duration, culture, learning strategy, and assessment tool) that might influence the effects of robot-supported CT cultivation. Moderator analyses indicated that short-term (less than four weeks) robot-supported learning had a larger effect (g = 0.901) on CT practice than long-term (more than eleven weeks) learning (g = 0.309).

Drawing together feminist perspectives on computing, constructionism, and care, we develop a notion of a technological ethic of care and locate this in children’s early coding experiences. Through critical discourse analysis, we present two cases where groups of children interacted with each other, their teachers, and a robot called Cubetto, establishing forms of responsibility for technology. We argue that an ethic of care must be part of computational discourses in an era of climate change, where caring for technologies and keeping them in working order is key to sustainable socio-ecological relations.",,"Educational robotics, Child–robot interaction, Ethic of care, Classroom learning, Relationships, Feminist theory"

To effectively meet these curricular requirements, teachers themselves need a solid foundation of computational thinking content knowledge, which refers to the understanding and skills they possess in this area. However, despite widespread recognition of this need, few studies have rigorously examined teachers' content knowledge in this domain. Addressing this gap requires the development of high-quality measurement tools. This study details the development of an instrument, created as part of the International Computer and Information Literacy Study (ICILS) 2023 in Flanders, to measure lower secondary school teachers' computational thinking content knowledge in a valid and reliable way. The article first outlines the construction process of the instrument, which involved close collaboration with experts in the field and drew upon the framework of Fraillon et al. (2023). Following this, the instrument's psychometric properties are presented, which include both item-level and overall instrument characteristics. These properties were evaluated using data from a sample of 352 participants, applying both Classical Test Theory and Item Response Theory. The final tool consists of sixteen multiple-choice and short constructed response questions. The results indicate favorable item and overall instrument characteristics, thereby affirming its potential to measure the intended construct in a valid and accurate way.",,"Evaluation methodologies, Secondary education, 21st century abilities"

Using qualitative analysis, we examined how parent voice and teacher voice, conceptualized as perspectives and participation, influenced theories of culturally responsive computing and computational thinking in early childhood education and the translation of theory into practice in classroom and home settings. Findings showed that connecting powerful ideas from computational thinking, namely algorithms and problem solving (e.g., debugging), to familiar activities and experiences served as a powerful entry point. Yet, differences arose in how teachers and parents conceptualized culturally relevant computing and made connections to familiar routines.

This has been associated with calls for computational thinking to be considered a ‘21St Century’ competency, valuable to all students as a transferable process for solving problems and building understanding of human behaviour and systems. However, while computational thinking is a focus of most secondary school computer science curricula, proponents such as Jeanette Wing argue its relevance for younger students, indicating more work must be done investigating its development in early years' education. This study used a structured, problem-based curriculum supported by guided inquiry pedagogy, to explore 6 year old students' learning of basic computational thinking concepts and practices while coding programmable floor robots (Blue-bots and an iPad app). Results indicated improvement across the seven lessons in students' sequencing/algorithm authoring, error correction, and pattern recognition. Furthermore, they revealed evidence of higher order thinking such as identifying patterns in code, and how these can be transferred to help solve problems of different designs. While currently play-based approaches are used to introduce computational thinking concepts and practices in early years' education, results from this study suggest that more structured, problem-based methods should be seriously considered. Results challenge commonly understood developmental theories about what young children can and can't do, contextualised within the field of computer science, and hold implications for early years' teachers' professional knowledge and pedagogy if they are to promote their students' learning in this increasingly important area. Given rapid technological advancements such as artificial intelligence (AI) and increasingly earlier exposure of young children to digitally-mediated information, this study provides support for the earlier and more systematic introduction of basic digital literacy knowledge and skills in early years' education.",,"Computational thinking, Coding, Kindergarten, Early years' education, Curriculum, Guided inquiry, Structured"

By embedding computational procedures and solution-oriented approaches into traditional curricula, students can develop essential skills that are critical for thriving in an increasingly digital world. However, the effective integration of CT into subject-specific learning poses challenges for educators, largely due to a lack of training and experience in implementing interdisciplinary instructional strategies. This study explores the impact of integrating CT into K-12 education through diverse instructional approaches, including modelling, storytelling, and unplugged activities. The research examines how students' subject knowledge, CT concepts, and practices evolved under each CT integration practice, as well as their acceptance toward CT integrated lessons. The study was conducted in different subjects, including language arts, biology, and physics, and at different grade levels. The technology acceptance model was used as a theoretical framework to understand students' adoption towards the different integration practices. The study revealed that different CT integration practices yield varying impacts on students' attitudes, particularly in relation to their prior programming experiences. Namely, primary school students with prior programming experience display a higher behavioural intention due to a lack of early biases toward programming. Conversely, secondary school students, less familiar with interdisciplinary approaches, initially show less enthusiasm for future engagement. These insights underscore the need for tailored instructional strategies that consider students' prior experiences and the broader goal of preparing them to contribute to a technologically driven society.",,"Computational thinking, Integration, K-12, Instructional strategy"

However, the question of how to engage children with coding activities within the context and limitations of the curriculum remains relatively explored. In our study, a human-centered design approach was followed to guide a small group of children through the co-design, implementation and evaluation of a board game. The board game had two versions: an offline version involving a robotic agent and an online version with its digital equivalent. A mixed-method approach was used to understand and compare levels of engagement, usability, and collaboration in both versions of the game. The tangible aspect of working with a robotic agent in the offline version led to greater levels of motivation and involvement with the game mechanics. Tangible robotics games tend to be more approachable for children. Our study shows that using such games by connecting the mathematics curriculum with coding problems can successfully engage participants in collaborative computational thinking activities. We contribute to the field by providing human-centered guidance for the creation of educational tools to develop computational thinking.

Therefore, this study investigates the impact of unplugged activities on novice students' CT skills and unravels the characteristics of students' CT competency from performing unplugged activities. The experimental aspect of this study was conducted with a cohort of 210 students participating in an introductory programming course at a University in Nigeria. A mixed-method research approach and a quasi-experimental design were applied in this study to understand how the unplugged approach in teaching CT could help students improve their CT competency. A paired-sample t-test of familiarity score for each CT concept showed a significant increase in the score before and after the intervention. Furthermore, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) was used for topic modeling of the text describing students’ solutions. Topic modeling allows for more insights into the steps taken by the students to solve CT problems. Only 27.62 % of students' solution descriptions contained CT concepts, 56.90 % of the students solved the puzzle with an optimal score, and 72.41 % of students who applied CT concepts of problem abstraction and decomposition were able to solve the puzzle correctly.

In this regard, LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) is considered one of the most widely recognized environmental assessment methods used globally in the construction industry today. However, due to the high level of complexity of the LEED system, the tools usually used to verify the achievement of the credits lack of “design friendliness” and hardly communicate effectively with the conventional tools used by architects and engineers (e.g. CAD, BIM). This makes difficult to fully take into account, especially at the early design stage, the many interconnected aspects that contribute to the green certification, with consequent issues often arising in the design validation and/or construction phases, resulting in time delays and cost increments. The application of innovative problem-solving methods, such as computational thinking, together with coding techniques, represents an effective way to deal with this issue. This kind of methodology, in fact, allows the requirements of a specific LEED credit to be digitally parametrised and flexibly incorporated into a “designer friendly” working environment. In particular, Visual Programming Languages (VPLs), due to their high simplicity of usage, allow architects and engineers to develop algorithms and thus implement their technical knowledge in the field of environmental design with computer programming skills, useful to improve their tools and keep them constantly updated. The aim of this paper is to illustrate a methodology through which, by merging computational thinking strategies with VPL tools, is possible to keep under control, in the same working environment, all the parameters required to verify in real time the achievement of LEED credits. To demonstrate the flexibility of the approach, dedicated tools developed for the verification of some specific credits at different scales – neighbourhood and building – are illustrated as operational examples of the proposed methodology.",,"LEED, Environmental Design, Computational Thinking, Visual Programming Language, Algorithm Aided Design"

This approach does not fulfill the potential of such integration for promoting learning. In this paper, we argue that digital literacies should not be bound to the digital realm, and present a novel approach to fully integrate CT into learning and teaching by the development of CT-infused “unplugged” pedagogical tools that are fully embedded in the subject matter. We demonstrate the advantages to student learning of these tools in two case studies from K-12 mathematics education: 1) An assistive tool for function investigation in high-school calculus – in this case, we point out to how CT skills that were implemented in the tool promoted students' problem solving; 2) A teaching unit for pattern sequences in elementary school – in this case, we show how students in the CT research group outperformed students in the other groups, and how they implemented CT to solve pattern sequence problems effectively and efficiently.

However, during this century, the teaching process has shifted from teaching with technology to solving problems with it. In this regard, pedagogical experts in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) have developed programming and robotics based on Computational Thinking skills (CTs), which have been regarded as the core of 21st-century skills. In the field of CALL, this skill has received very little attention. Accordingly, we have attempted to switch the process and outcome of language learning in VE. Thus, we developed the conceptual framework that integrated CTsCALL and Individual-technology-task-environment Fit (ITTEF). Having designed our VE tasks based on CTsCALL, we provided the opportunity for 92 Spanish language learners in our project to exchange language and culture with Cypriot and Irish students and solve VE tasks based on CTsCALL. The result of the symmetric phase of the study validated the five-dimensional structure of CTsCALL and the four-dimensional structures of ITTEF in VE and CALL. It also revealed that language learners, who focused on the key information rather than the details while solving language tasks, as well as recognizing the pattern of task solving and applying them to other tasks, found VE, and CTsCALL to be aligned with their current capabilities, learning environment, and problem-solving skills that mediated their intention to learn and exchange information in this context in the future. Furthermore, the asymmetrical part of the study revealed that sixteen solutions are available to shape language learners' continued intention to use VE by combining the components of CTsCALL and ITTEF. Thus, the study developed the CTsCALL questionnaire and its theory into CALL together with the Council of Europe's Common European Framework of Reference for Languages and recommended that CALL researchers and educators take a broader view of VE, as well as continuing to validate CTsCALL in other CALL disciplines to show that this skill belongs to CALL as well.",,"21st-century digital skills, 21st-century digital competence, English language learning, Technology acceptance models, English language teaching, Applied linguistic, Task-technology fit"

However, there is no consensus on which components of CT to teach beginning coders in early childhood education (ECE). To address this issue, we conducted a systematic review of 42 empirical studies focused on teaching and assessing CT in ECE. We analyzed the included studies with the three-dimensional CT framework proposed by Brennan and Resnick (2012) and demonstrated how this framework could be modified to fit the context of ECE. Based on this systematic review, we sorted out the CT components that were proven suitable for young children to learn by incorporating emerging components and removing components inappropriate for young children. We thus proposed a CT curriculum framework for ECE that covers CT concepts (i.e., control flow/structures, representation, and hardware/software), CT practices (i.e., algorithmic design, pattern recognition, abstraction, debugging, decomposition, iteration, and generalizing), and CT perspectives (i.e., expressing and creating, connecting, perseverance, and choices of conduct).

The systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to address three research questions: 1) Which executive functions are most impacted by the teaching of CT? 2) Which instructional modality (educational robotics/virtual coding/unplugged coding) is most effective in enhancing executive function skills in learners aged 4–16 years? and 3) Does the cognitive effectiveness of coding vary with children's age? A total of 19 studies with 1523 participants met the selection criteria for the systematic review. The meta-analysis included 11 of those studies. The results reveal beneficial effects of structured virtual and tangible coding (educational robotics) activities for preschoolers and first graders, and significant effects of more unstructured virtual coding activities (e.g., Scratch-based) for older students. A multivariate fixed-effects model meta-analysis shows that the teaching of coding significantly improves problem-solving with the highest effect (dppc2 = 0.89), but also planning (dppc2 = 0.36), and inhibition and working memory with lower effects (dppc2 = 0.17, dppc2 = 0.20).",,"Coding, Computational thinking, Executive function, Problem solving, Children, Intervention"

This article addresses the critical need to comprehend the factors influencing the acceptance of computational thinking. The dataset introduces an extensive questionnaire comprising five constructs and 25 items, rooted in the extended Technology Acceptance Model. Notably, the model incorporates facilitating conditions and subjective norm, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding acceptance. Data collection involved 132 undergraduate university students sampled through purposive sampling, specifically targeting courses with a focus on computational thinking. The resulting dataset serves as a valuable resource for future research, offering detailed insights into the factors determining the acceptance of technology in educational contexts beyond mere thinking skills. Given the scarcity of research on technology acceptance in developing nations, this dataset holds particular significance, serving as a foundation for potential cross-cultural comparisons. The dataset contributes to the field by presenting a robust acceptance model, explaining 74.2 per cent of the variance in behavioural intention, 60.2 per cent in perceived usefulness, and 56.1 per cent in perceived ease of use. This high explanatory power positions the dataset as a superior resource for replication, benchmarking, and broader applicability in diverse contexts, thereby enhancing the understanding of computational thinking acceptance across different populations and settings.

For this reason, this systematic mapping synthesizes 82 studies on CT teaching, through the implementation and evaluation of tools and activities to teach, improve or measure the CT knowledge acquired by children. Furthermore, studies on courses or training offered to preschool teachers related to the teaching of CT were also considered. From the selected studies, the following information was collected: year of publication; recovery sources and databases; vehicles and places of publication; temporal delimitation of research, research approach, nature and research method; CT teaching approaches; tools used to teach CT and how they are classified according to their physical characteristics and, finally, participants and individuals responsible for the research. The results suggest an increase in the number of publications in recent years, revealing the interest of researchers in the topic. Furthermore, we observed a trend towards the use of physical artifacts and the use of the disconnected computing approach to teaching CT skills to preschool children. The results also exposed that preschool teachers have little autonomy in implementing CT teaching activities because those are mostly implemented by computer professionals (researchers, teachers, etc.). This is because preschool teachers are still discouraged from teaching computer and technology-related content to children, considering them complex and disconnected from basic curricula. However, when teachers are trained to teach CT, they become interested in the content and become more active during the teaching process. We argue for integrating CT-related content into education curricula and supporting preschool teachers to implement it autonomously in their classrooms.",,"Computational thinking, Early childhood, Preschool, Systematic mapping"

While design thinking has traditionally been the cornerstone of university design pedagogy and remains essential, the increasing role of digital tools and artificial intelligence in modern design practices presents new opportunities for innovation. By introducing CT alongside design thinking, students can expand their creative toolkit and engage with emerging technologies more effectively. Although many design students may have limited experience with programming, incorporating accessible, no-code tools can help them confidently embrace computational methods, unlocking new pathways for creative exploration and innovation. This study proposes an alternative approach to improve the motivation of design students by introducing machine learning tools into product design processes. We developed an experimental pedagogy in which 56 industrial design university students learned how to use Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (Weka), a machine learning tool, for three hours of design work a week, for a total of eight weeks. Our covariate analysis of data collected in the pretest and posttest shows that the general learning motivations in the group using Weka are significantly higher than those in the group without Weka. However, no significant differences were found between the two groups in terms of learning strategies, collaboration, or critical thinking. Students using Weka spent more time focusing on model training and tended to improve their algorithmic thinking, and the introduction of Weka appeared to enhance their motivation to learn. On the other hand, these students might have been focusing on working individually at their computers, potentially neglecting communication and collaboration. The findings suggest that teaching machine learning applications without requiring coding has the potential to boost design students' motivation to engage with CT skills, though care must be taken to maintain collaborative practices.",,"Computational thinking, Learning motivation, Teaching technology, Industrial design, Machine learning, Student self-assessment"

Therefore, research on CT assessment has lately progressed towards developing and validating reliable CT assessment tools, which are crucial for evaluating students' potential learning progress and thus the effectiveness of suggested curricular programs. Several CT assessment tools were developed for elementary, high-school, and university students over the last years. Moreover, associations between CT scores and other cognitive abilities were unraveled. However, studies on the topic in primary school level are scarce. Like the general concept of intelligence, CT remains broadly defined as the ability to combine algorithmic operations to form complex solutions in order to solve problems effectively, utilizing concepts of computer science with or without the use of computers. In this study, we aimed at specifying a cognitive definition of CT, focusing on the under-investigated population of primary school children. Since validated assessment tools for this age group were not available, we adapted a validated CT test, which was initially designed for middle school students. In our study participated 192 third and fourth graders. The analyses revealed promising results on the reliability of the adapted CT assessment for primary school students. Moreover, findings indicated CT's positive associations with i. complex numerical abilities, ii. verbal reasoning abilities, and iii. non-verbal visuospatial abilities. Our results indicate similarities but also differences in associations of CT with other cognitive abilities in primary school children compared to other age groups. In summary: i. numerical abilities seem to associate with CT at the primary school level, whereas this seems not the case later on in education, ii. verbal abilities seem to associate with CT both along primary and secondary education levels, and iii. non-verbal reasoning abilities seem to associate with CT from primary education level to the university level and beyond.

This research investigates the effectiveness of a scalable and sustainable teacher development programme in promoting CT in primary education. This report presents two studies. Study 1 reports on the effectiveness of two 12-h courses using Scratch and App Inventor programming environments for CT development of teachers respectively, which involved 245 teachers from 47 primary schools. With teaching practices embedded, the programme, which used the framework of technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK), significantly enhanced teachers' content-related knowledge dimensions. The results indicate that the programme helped teachers develop advanced CT concepts such as data structures and procedures. Study 2, using thematic analysis, reports on CT strategies implemented in 47 schools through 94 school visits. The most mentioned strategies were the formation of teaching teams, lesson co-planning, and the integration of CT with subject teaching. The most mentioned challenges were teacher readiness, lesson time, and diversity – learners' abilities, interests, and approaches. Four types of support, including teacher development support, continuous and communal support, teaching materials support, and financial support were identified. The results suggest that a course-based programme with mixed programming environments and embedded teaching experience effectively develops teachers’ capabilities. However, continuous support for teachers in implementing the initiative after completing the programme is important, especially in addressing learner diversity and integrating CT with subject teaching.",,"Computational thinking, Primary schools, Scaling up, School visits, Teacher development"

We conducted mixed-methods research with 203 secondary school girls (in the state of Victoria, Australia) and 31 mentors attending a girls-only CT program (OzGirlsCT program). The girls were grouped into 52 teams and collaboratively developed computational solutions around realistic, important problems to them and their communities. We distributed two surveys (with 193 responses each) to the girls. Further, we surveyed the mentors (with 31 responses) who monitored the girls, and collected their observation reports on their teams Our study indicates that the girls found “debugging” the most difficult type of CT practice to apply, while collaborative practices of CT were the easiest. We found that prior coding experience significantly reduced the difficulty level of only one CT practice - “debugging”.

JeanetteWing’s seminal work on Computational Thinking (CT) is an important landmark for this goal: CT represents a way of thinking, a set of problem-solving skills which can be valuable when interacting with digital technologies, and with different fields of knowledge, such as Arts and Humanities. Even if this cross-areas relevance has been celebrated and acknowledged in theoretical research, there has been a lack of practical projects exploring these links between CT and non-STEM fields. This research develops these links. We present a specific case – a game produced by two 14 years-old boys – within Playing Beowulf, a collaboration with the British library’s Young Researchers programme, in which students aged 13–14 from an inner-London (UK) school have developed games based on their own readings of the Anglo-Saxon poem Beowulf during an after-school club. The game was produced using MissionMaker, a software (currently under development at UCL Knowledge Lab) that allows users to create and code their own first-person 3D games in a simple way, using pre-made 3D assets, such as rooms, props, characters and weapons and a simplified programming language manipulated through drop-down lists. We argue that MissionMaker, by simplifying the development process (low floor), can be a means to foster the building of knowledge in both STEM (CT) and Arts and Humanities, building bridges between these two areas inside and outside traditional schooling.",,"Game-making, Computational thinking, Arts, Humanities"

There have been attempts to investigate learners’ computer programming patterns using high-frequency and automated data collection. This approach can be considered as process-based analysis as opposed to outcome-based analysis (i.e., the use of test or exam scores). In this process-based approach to investigate learners’ computer programming process, we included two critical constructs in our research, self-regulated learning and computational thinking skills. We aimed to identify learners’ computer programming patterns in the context that novice students learn a computer programming language, Python, in an online coding environment. We examined the relationships between the learners’ coding patterns, self-regulated learning, and computational thinking skills. Initially, we adopted a traditional approach with the aggregate data of learners’ computer programming behaviors. We then utilized a computational analytics approach to learner performance, self-regulated learning, and computational thinking skills, with ever-changing computer programming patterns. In our initial approach, the indicators of aggregate computer programming data were not associated with learners' learning performance and computational thinking skills. In the computational analysis approach, many indicators revealed significant differences between the identified patterns regarding computational thinking skills and self-regulated learning.

Thus, it is intended to provide a new instrument for CT measurement and additionally give evidence of the nature of CT through its associations with key related psychological constructs. Results show statistically significant correlations at least moderately intense between CT and: spatial ability (r = 0.44), reasoning ability (r = 0.44), and problem-solving ability (r = 0.67).

Thirty Children aged 10–11 years, from a primary school in London took part in a game-making project using the Scratch and Alice 2.4 applications for eight months. For the focus of this specific paper, data from participant observations, informal conversations, problem-solving sheets, semi-structured interviews and children’s completed games were used to make sense of elements of the computational thinking process and approaches to evaluate these elements in a computer game design context. The discussions around what CT consists, highlighted the complex structure of computational thinking and the interaction between the elements of artificial intelligence (AI), computer, cognitive, learning and psychological sciences. This also emphasised the role of metacognition in the Computational Thinking process. These arguments illustrated that it is not possible to evaluate Computational Thinking using only programming constructs, as CT process provides opportunities for developing many other skills and concepts. Therefore a multiple evaluation approach should be adopted to illustrate the full learning scope of the Computational Thinking Process.

One way to advance in this area is to investigate whether ‘computationally talented’ students (i.e., ‘computational top thinkers’) can be detected even before learning to code; and, if so, how to teach them properly to fully develop their high-computational ability. This paper presents several empirical concatenated studies about the predictive validity of the Computational Thinking Test (CTt), which is administered on a sample of 314 middle school Spanish students (n=314). We report the predictive validity of the CTt, conducted at the beginning of the quarter, with respect to academic performance (Informatics, Mathematics, and Language) and learning analytics in a Code.org course collected at the end of the quarter. We also analyze the predictive validity of the CTt to early distinguish between ‘computational regular thinkers’ and ‘computational top thinkers’ (i.e., those who spontaneously accelerated from the ‘block-based’ programming environment of Code.org to the ‘text-based’ one of Khan Academy). Finally, we perform a case study over two of the students categorized as ‘computational top thinkers’, in which one of their coding products written in Processing JavaScript is described. Our results demonstrate that ‘computationally talented’ students can be detected in middle school, and that these subjects have the ability to accelerate in the Computer Science Education standards between 1 and 2 years compared to the regular learners. This could have major implications on the emerging computing curricula, which should take into account these individual differences in computational ability and ‘learning-how-to-code’ speed to ensure an appropriate progression for every student.",,"Computational thinking, Computational thinking test, Computational talent, Cognitive assessment, Predictive validity"

This study developed an operational definition for CT practices by exploring the key dimensions of their composition and, more importantly, developed and validated a generic test tool that can effectively assess students’ CT practices. Items to measure CT practices were developed using the evidence-centered design (ECD) approach. These items prompted students to exhibit behaviors that demonstrated their skills in the four dimensions of CT practice, namely testing and debugging, algorithmic thinking, reusing and remixing, and abstracting and modularizing. A test consisting of these items was administered to 13,956 Grade 4–6 primary school students from 56 public schools in Hong Kong. The data were analyzed based on the item response theory (IRT) approach, together with other psychometric tests. A bi-factor three-parameter logistic model was ultimately adopted for test validation, as it fitted the data better than the corresponding two-parameter and one-parameter logistic models. The results validated the four-dimensional structure of the CT practices test.

A total of 714 K-12 students in China's Zhejiang Province participated in this study and completed an online questionnaire, which included the learning engagement scale and the high-order thinking tendency scale. Cross-sectional survey data were analyzed using Pearson's correlation coefficient and hierarchical multiple regression as a way to examine the relationship between the variables. The results showed that cognitive engagement, emotional engagement, and behavioral engagement were all key factors in developing those students' higher-order thinking for programming learning activities in K-12 students during associated activities. Furthermore, when the students' emotional engagements were elevated, the positive relationships between cognitive engagement, computational thinking, and creative thinking were closer. Inversely, when students' behavioral engagement was high, the positive relationship between cognitive engagement and critical thinking, and the positive relationship between emotional engagement and problem-solving and critical thinking became looser. These results can help deepen educators' understanding of the relationship between learning engagement and higher-order thinking skills to facilitate their search for effective strategies to improve programming instruction.

From the review results, it was found that the promotion of CT in education has made great progress in the last decade. In addition to the increasing number of CT studies in different countries, the subjects, research issues, and teaching tools have also become more diverse in recent years. It was also found that CT has mainly been applied to the activities of program design and computer science, while some studies are related to other subjects. Meanwhile, most of the studies adopted Project-Based Learning, Problem-Based Learning, Cooperative Learning, and Game-based Learning in the CT activities. In other words, such activities as aesthetic experience, design-based learning, and storytelling have been relatively less frequently adopted. Most of the studies focused on programming skills training and mathematical computing, while some adopted a cross-domain teaching mode to enable students to manage and analyze materials of various domains by computing. In addition, since the cognitive ability of students of different ages varies, the CT ability cultivation methods and content criteria should vary accordingly. Moreover, most studies reported the learners' CT performance and perspectives, while their information society ability was seldom trained.

However, extant studies lack a thorough investigation of these supply issues in a post-disaster environment. This paper aims to understand the factors influencing post-disaster building material supply and the mechanisms contributing to the supply problems. Thus, the authors analysed 49 publications from 2005 to 2023 and identified 42 influencing factors and 226 causal relationships. These factors were classified into three groups, namely, 1) contextual sub-system, 2) operational sub-system, and 3) stakeholder sub-system. Drawing on the data, a causal loop diagram (CLD) was developed, and numerous feedback loops were identified within and between systems. Through a network analysis of the CLD, five leverage factors were identified as systemic interventions for policymakers to consider in improving building material supply performance for post-disaster recovery, namely, regulatory arrangements and governance, competence and capability of stakeholders, stakeholder relationship, availability of local materials, and resource exploitation. However, CLD and network analysis also revealed the need for further investigation of the mechanisms and interventions related to building material supply in disaster contexts. To better understand and address post-disaster building material supply problems, ongoing studies can be further advanced by the better utilisation of extant knowledge, the application of systems thinking approaches and computational modelling methods.",,"Building material supply, Post-disaster recovery, Systematic review, Systems thinking, Network analysis"

However, at present, analysis remains scant on the correlation between students' programming attitudes and their CT skills, and less attention is paid to the influencing effects of gender and programming experience. This study first validated a newly developed programming attitudes scale (χ2/df = 2.308, RMSEA = 0.073, CFI = 0.925, TLI = 0.912) among 1180 seventh-grade students (12–13 years old). It then analyzed the relationship between students' programming attitudes and CT skills considering gender differences. Students' programming attitudes significantly predicted their CT skills. Girls have higher CT skills than boys, but their more negative programming attitudes may affect their continued skill development. Third, the relationship among programming experience, programming attitudes, and CT skills was discussed among the sample (N = 175) with programming experience, revealing that programming attitudes played an intermediary role between programming experience and CT skills. Two specific factors of programming experience (first time learning programming and programming learning duration) had differing effects on students' programming attitudes and CT skills. For programming attitudes, the grade in which students got started with programming had no effect on their programming attitudes, but programming attitudes rose with increased programming learning time. For CT, students who learned programming starting in second grade possessed the highest CT level. In addition, there is an inverted U-shaped curve between students' programming learning duration and CT skills, peaked at the fourth year of programming learning career. Implications for promoting junior high school students’ CT skills and their positive attitudes toward programming are also discussed.",,"Computational thinking, Programming attitudes, Programming experience, Gender, Students, Junior high school"

To clarify this, we develop a meta-control account of RNT. Meta-control refers to the reinforcement and control of mental behavior via similar computations as reinforce and control motor behavior. We propose rumination and worry are coarse terms for failure in meta-control, just as tripping and falling are coarse terms for failure in motor control. We delineate four meta-control stages and risk factors increasing the chance of failure at each, including open-ended thoughts (stage 1), individual differences influencing subgoal execution (stage 2) and switching (stage 3), and challenges inherent to learning adaptive mental behavior (stage 4). Distinguishing these stages therefore elucidates diverse processes that lead to the same behavior of excessive RNT.

Others involve sacrificing some level of accuracy to achieve much more scalable running times. For the selected algorithm, different choices of problem decomposition can result in different levels of interference between threads, parallelism exposed, load imbalance, and other performance considerations during parallel execution.

As one of the mainstream forms of programming education activities, unplugged programming activities are mainly implemented in the early stage of basic education. However, considering the lack of programming experience among Chinese junior high schoolers and the uneven distribution of programming education resources, an 8-week quasi-experimental study was conducted to verify the effectiveness of unplugged activities in improving junior high schoolers’ CT skills, and to identify the influence of multiple factors. A total of 93 7th-graders volunteered to participate in the experiment: 62 students were divided into two experimental groups, which were intervened by unplugged activities to repeat the results’ reliability, and 31 students were used as the control group without any unplugged programming activities. The results of the intra-group and inter-group comparison show that unplugged programming is a more effective way to improve 7th-graders’ CT skills. Students’ mathematic performance and previous programming experience had a significant impact on their CT skills, but this impact is not reflected in the process of unplugged programming activities. It can be said that all students can develop their CT skills through unplugged programming activities, regardless of their learning background. In the current context, unplugged programming activities can be used as an effective way for junior high schoolers to improve and develop their CT skills.

Two types of mind mapping, construct-by-self mind mapping (CBS-MM) and construct-on-scaffold mind mapping (COS-MM), were proposed to compare which type is more effective in terms of students' CT skills. Seventy-three public primary school fifth-grade students aged 10 to 11 participated in the study. The CBS group included 33 students learning with the CBS-MM instructional approach, while the COS group comprised 40 students learning with the COS-MM instructional approach. Data were obtained from nine topic Scratch programming assignments and pre- and post-CT skills surveys completed by the two groups. Paired sample t tests were used to analyze whether the two types of mind mapping approach could improve both groups' CT skills. One-way ANCOVA and one-way ANOVA were used to examine the difference in the two groups' CT skills. The results showed that both CBS-MM and COS-MM can improve students' CT skills; however, the COS group students could better improve their CT skills with the assistance of the COS-MM method compared with the CBS group students who learned with the CBS-MM method.

We compared children receiving CAL (N = 667) to a control group (N = 181) who participated in typical classroom activities without coding (No-CAL). TechCheck, a validated “unplugged” CT assessment suitable for young children regardless of their coding experience, was used to measure CT. Over the course of the study, children who received CAL-KIBO improved on TechCheck (Mchange = 0.94, p < .001) whereas the No-CAL group did not change significantly (Mchange = 0.27, p = .07). Accounting for demographic factors, baseline performance and classroom (teacher) effects, CAL exposure was a significant predictor of post-test CT scores (p < .01). Improvements in CT measured by TechCheck over seven weeks of the CAL-KIBO curriculum were consistent with approximately six months of development without coding instruction. Secondary analysis stratified by grade revealed decisive evidence that CAL exposure improved scores in first grade and anecdotal evidence that second grade scores improved. The CT domains that showed improvement in children who received CAL-KIBO included algorithms, modularity, and representation. Young children who learned to code improved in solving unplugged problems that were not explicitly taught in the coding curriculum.

In this paper, we propose a d score of T2FN to reveal their interaction mechanism, where an interaction coefficient θ is used to measure the interaction. This score describes fast and slow thinking patterns and the transformation process between them, and how the interaction helps decision makers make better decisions. We propose two optimization models to solve for the coefficient θ. With the collected data based on questionnaires, we find a dominant role of interactive thinking in practice. In particular, it is most common that fast thinking and slow thinking play equally important roles in forming our judgments.

The purpose of this research is to assess and evaluate the effect of key indicators for creative thinking skills on increased achievement and motivation in learning Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM). In this study, the authors aim to determine whether children aged between 3 and 6 can provide creative solutions for learning difficulties in a digital environment. Moreover, the authors have identified and assessed children's behaviors that enhance their learning achievement and motivation. To achieve this, a mixed-methods case study approach was employed, combining quantitative and qualitative analysis techniques. The ""Analyzing Children's Creative Thinking"" (ACCT) framework was used to investigate and identify the impact of key creative thinking skills indicators. Additionally, Motivational Strategies for Learning Questionnaires (MSLQ) were used to evaluate children's perceptions and motivation in the digital STEM-based learning environment. The findings indicate that digital STEM-based learning has the potential to influence students' ability to develop creative skills and critical thinking, as well as foster positive attitudes toward learning, which may lead to deep and meaningful learning experiences. The results of psychomotor testing of children before and after playing in the STEM-based learning environment demonstrate the typical developmental profile of fine motor skills during learning for the participating children.

However, providing largescale evaluations of open-ended answers is time consuming and poses challenges regarding the objectivity, validity, and replicability of ratings. To address this issue, we investigated the extent to which computer-based evaluation methods are suitable for evaluating student answers by combining qualitative methods from history education research with quantitative, computer-based linguistic analyses. In two studies, we analyzed data from an intervention study in which 962 students (ninth graders) completed seven open-ended tasks. In Study 1, we investigated the extent to which task complexity could be predicted from the linguistic complexity of the students' answers. In Study 2, we conducted an automatic content assessment by aligning student answers with predefined target answers and compared automatic scores with human ratings that were based on an elaborate evaluation scheme we developed. In our first study, we identified several linguistic features of students’ answers that successfully predicted task complexity. In our second study, the correlations between manual and computational task scores were encouraging. However, our human interrater agreement left room for improvement and demonstrated the challenges of reliably applying explicit evaluation criteria to open tasks.

However, in psychological terms, CT is still a poorly defined construct, given that its nomological network has not been established yet. In a previous paper, we started to address this issue studying the correlations between CT and some fundamental cognitive variables, such as primary mental abilities and problem-solving ability. The current work deepens in the same direction as it aims to extend the nomological network of CT with non-cognitive factors, through the study of the correlations between CT, self-efficacy and the several dimensions from the ‘Big Five’ model of human personality: Openness to Experience, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism. To do so, the Computational Thinking Test (CTt) and some additional self-efficacy items are administered on a sample of 1251 Spanish students from 5th to 10th grade (N = 1251), and the Big Five Questionnaire-Children version (BFQ-C) is also taken by a subsample from the above (n = 99). Results show statistically significant correlations between CT and self-efficacy perception relative to CT performance (rs = 0.41), in which gender differences in favor of males are found (d = 0.42). Moreover, results show statistically significant correlations between CT and: Openness to Experience (r = 0.41), Extraversion (r = 0.30), and Conscientiousness (r = 0.27). These findings are consistent with the existing literature except for the unexpected correlation between CT and the Extraversion factor of personality, which is consequently discussed in detail.

There is a lack of high-quality empirical research on teacher development in CT in relation to programming. This study addressed that situation by providing empirical evidence of the design and evaluation of such a teacher development program in primary schools. Seventy-six in-service teachers participated in a program comprising two 39-h courses. One course focused on the fundamental subject knowledge of programming for CT development together with pedagogy. The other focused on the development of advanced knowledge while providing opportunities to practice teaching in the classroom and to reflect on the practice. The results indicate that the participants developed a better understanding of CT concepts and practices and improved in three of the four content knowledge related dimensions of technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) across the two courses. The three dimensions were content knowledge of programming for CT development, technological content knowledge of the use of block-based programming environments for programming for CT development, and use of the environment to teach programming for CT development with the appropriate pedagogy in context. Analysis of the participants' self-reported reflections suggested that the two courses and the teaching experience acquired during the prolonged second course were the two main sources of improvement. This study demonstrates the importance of providing an effective teacher development program with a focus on CT concepts and practices. The program offers teachers a sustained period in which to practice in the classroom and reflect on their teaching while developing their capacity to implement CT in relation to programming.",,"Computational thinking, CT concepts, CT practices, Teacher development, TPACK"

Systems thinking methods, such as causal loop diagrams and systems dynamic models, offer powerful means to capture and study this complexity. Recent studies developed and validated a causal loop diagram and system dynamics model using multiple longitudinal data sets, enabling the simulation of personalized interventions on various modifiable risk factors in LOAD. The results indicate that targeting factors like sleep disturbance and depressive symptoms could be promising and yield synergistic benefits. Furthermore, personalized interventions showed significant potential, with top-ranked intervention strategies differing significantly across individuals. We argue that systems thinking approaches can open new prospects for multifactorial precision medicine.

The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of partial pair programming (PPP) on elementary school students' CT skills and self-efficacy (SE). The study included four 4th grade classes, with a total of 171 students, who were taking the course entitled “Computational Thinking with Scratch” with the same teacher for one semester. Two classes (84 students) were in the Experimental Group (EG, 44 boys and 40 girls) while two other classes (87 students) were in the Control Group (CG, 45 boys and 42 girls). The students in the EG were paired up for the programming assignments while the students in the CG did the assignments on their own. The results showed that the students in the EG improved their CT skills and SE more significantly than those in the CG group. There was a low correlation between CT and SE in the post-test of both groups. The interviews with the teacher and the students afterwards provided insights in understanding the results. The findings suggest that in K-12 programming teachers could use PPP as an effective approach to improve students’ CT skills, programming SE, and beyond.",,"Elementary education, Classroom teaching, Computational thinking, Partial pair programming, Self-efficacy, Pair collaborative learning"

Computer science, and especially High Performance Computing, has become a key factor in the development of many research fields, establishing a new paradigm called computational science. Researchers and professionals from many different fields require knowledge of High Performance Computing, including parallel programming, to develop fruitful and efficient work in their particular field. Therefore, at Universitat Autònoma of Barcelona (Spain), an interdisciplinary Master on “Modeling for Science and Engineering” was started 5 years ago to provide a thorough knowledge of the application of modeling and simulation to graduate students in different fields (Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Engineering, Geology, etc.). In this Master’s degree, “Parallel Programming” appears as a compulsory subject because it is a key topic for them. The concepts learned in this subject must be applied to real applications. Therefore, a complementary subject on “Applied Modeling and Simulation” has also been included. It is very important to show the students how to analyze their particular problems, think about them from a computational perspective and consider the related performance issues. So, in this paper, the methodology and the experience in introducing computational thinking, parallel programming and performance engineering in this interdisciplinary Master’s degree are shown.

We measured their engagement and collaboration during the activity by recording their gaze, and their attitudes in relation to their learning, enjoyment, team-work and intention by post-activity survey instruments. Our analysis shows that there is a significant moderating effect of collaboration and engagement on children’s attitudes.

This study intended to analyze and predict the differences in the self-perception of achieved complex thinking competency by gender, semester, course of study and high school of origin. Design/methodology/approach The methodology included applying the E-Complexity instrument to 225 university students from northern Mexico. The initial comparison of groups used the chi-square test and two supervised learning algorithms (logit regression with Lasso regularization and a classification tree). Findings The findings of this study indicated that the selected undergraduate degree did not reveal differences in self-perceived performance in complex thinking, while gender, semester and high school of origin had significant differences. Research limitations/implications Among the limitations of the study is the size of the sample and the fact that it only focused on engineering students from a single educational institution; however, this limitation responds to the exploratory nature of this study and the guidance of the institutional ethics committee. With these results, it is feasible to request an extension of the sample to include other disciplines to evaluate these findings, which, although relevant, cannot be considered exhaustive. Originality/value Regarding possible lines of research, the authors propose that given the difference between students who graduated from the high school of the same institution and those who did not, a possible line of research could explore new hypotheses on whether the policies and practices of the institution’s high school emphasize the development of complex thinking skills; the teachers of this high school are trained to teach complex thinking; and the learning materials of this high school are designed to develop complex thinking skills.",,"Professional education, Educational innovation, Complex thinking, Logit regression, Lasso regularization, Life-long learning"

The present study thus addresses this challenge. Guidance and feedback were considered as critical intervention methods to foster CT competences in ER settings. A between-subjects experiment was conducted with 66 students aged 8 to 9 in the context of a remote collaborative robot programming mission, with four experimental conditions. A two-step strategy was employed to report students' CT competence (their performance and learning process). Firstly, the students' CT learning gains were measured through a pre-post-test design. Secondly, video analysis was used to identify the creative computational problem-solving patterns involved in the experimental condition that had the most favourable impact on the students’ CT scores. Results show that delayed feedback is an effective intervention method for CT development in ER activities.

Previous work has found that people do this by learning the general value of different behaviors, and prioritizing thinking about high-value options in new situations. Is this good-action bias always the best strategy, or can thinking about low-value options sometimes become more beneficial? Can people adapt their thinking accordingly based on the situation? And how do we know what to think about in novel events? Here, we developed a block-puzzle paradigm that enabled us to measure people's thinking plans and compare them to a computational model of rational thought. We used two distinct response methods to explore what people think about—a self-report method, in which we asked people explicitly to report what they thought about, and an implicit response time method, in which we used people's decision-making times to reveal what they thought about. Our results suggest that people can quickly estimate the apparent value of different options and use this to decide what to think about. Critically, we find that people can flexibly prioritize whether to think about high-value options (Experiments 1 and 2) or low-value options (Experiments 3, 4, and 5), depending on the problem. Through computational modeling, we show that these thinking strategies are broadly rational, enabling people to maximize the value of long-term decisions. Our results suggest that thinking plans are flexible: What we think about depends on the structure of the problems we are trying to solve.",,"Computational modeling, Thinking, Decision-making"

Traditional optimization algorithms utilize two main concepts: exploration, to expand the search range, and exploitation, to enhance solution accuracy. However, as problem complexity and application scenarios increase, MHS struggles to balance exploration and exploitation to find the optimal solution. Therefore, this paper introduces innovative characteristics of individual thinking and proposes a new Thinking Innovation Strategy (TIS). TIS does not aim for an optimal solution but seeks global optimization based on successful individuals, enhancing algorithm performance through survival of the fittest. This paper applies TIS strategies to improve various MHS algorithms and evaluates their performance on 57 engineering problems and the IEEE CEC2020 benchmarks.

The study examined the relationship among student gameplay, related classroom activity, and the development of students’ CT practices in Zoombinis classes. A combination of research methods, including educational data-mining on game data logs, cluster analysis on teacher logs of classroom activity, and multilevel modeling, was used to determine the impact of the duration and nature of student gameplay, as well as the extent and nature of classroom activity, on student CT practices. Automated detectors of gameplay CT practices built for this research were significant predictors of external post-assessment scores, and thus show promise as implicit assessments of CT practices within gameplay. Students with high duration of gameplay and high gameplay CT practices scored highest on external post-assessment of CT practices, when accounting for pre-assessment scores. This research suggests that Zoombinis is an effective CT learning tool and CT assessment tool for elementary- and middle-school students.",,"Computational thinking, Assessment, Game-based learning"

With operating rooms costing approximately US $36 per minute, efficient scheduling is vital. However, global practices in surgical scheduling vary, largely due to challenges in predicting individual surgeon times for diverse patient conditions. Inspired by the Toyota Production System’s efficiency in addressing similar logistical challenges, we applied its principles as detailed in the book “Lean Thinking” by Womack and Jones, which identifies processes that do not meet customer needs as wasteful. This insight is critical in health care, where waste can compromise patient safety and medical quality. Objective This study aims to use lean thinking and Toyota methods to develop a more efficient surgical scheduling system that better aligns with user needs without additional financial burdens. Methods We implemented the 5 principles of the Toyota system: specifying value, identifying the value stream, enabling flow, establishing pull, and pursuing perfection. Value was defined in terms of meeting the customer’s needs, which in this context involved developing a responsive and efficient scheduling system. Our approach included 2 subsystems: one handling presurgery patient data and another for intraoperative and postoperative data. We identified inefficiencies in the presurgery data subsystem and responded by creating a comprehensive value stream map of the surgical process. We developed 2 Excel (Microsoft Corporation) macros using Visual Basic for Applications. The first calculated average surgery times from intra- or postoperative historic data, while the second estimated surgery durations and generated concise, visually engaging scheduling reports from presurgery data. We assessed the effectiveness of the new system by comparing task completion times and user satisfaction between the old and new systems. Results The implementation of the revised scheduling system significantly reduced the overall scheduling time from 301 seconds to 261 seconds (P=.02), with significant time reductions in the revised process from 99 seconds to 62 seconds (P<.001). Despite these improvements, approximately 21% of nurses preferred the older system for its familiarity. The new system protects patient data privacy and streamlines schedule dissemination through a secure LINE group (LY Corp), ensuring seamless flow. The design of the system allows for real-time updates and has been effectively monitoring surgical durations daily for over 3 years. The “pull” principle was demonstrated when an unplanned software issue prompted immediate, user-led troubleshooting, enhancing system reliability. Continuous improvement efforts are ongoing, except for the preoperative patient confirmation step, which requires further enhancement to ensure optimal patient safety. Conclusions Lean principles and Toyota’s methods, combined with computer programming, can revitalize surgical scheduling processes. They offer effective solutions for surgical scheduling challenges and enable the creation of a novel surgical scheduling system without incurring additional costs.",,"algorithm, process, computational thinking, continuous improvement, customer needs, lean principles, problem solving, Toyota Production System, value stream map, need, needs, operating room"

Existing measures of PT are limited by demand and expectancy effects, cognitive biases, and reflexivity, leading to calls for unobtrusive, behavioral measures. In response, we developed a behavioral measure of PT based on language. A mixed sample of 188 participants with major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, or no psychopathology completed self-report PT measures. Participants were also interviewed, providing a natural language sample. We examined language features associated with PT, then built a language-based PT model and examined its predictive power. PT was associated with multiple language features, most notably I-usage (e.g., “I”, “me”; β = 0.25) and negative emotion language (e.g., “anxiety”, “difficult”; β = 0.19). In machine learning analyses, language features accounted for 14% of the variance in self-reported PT. Language-based PT predicted the presence and severity of depression and anxiety, psychiatric comorbidity, and treatment seeking, with effects in the r = 0.15–0.41 range. PT has face-valid linguistic correlates and our language-based measure holds promise for assessing PT unobtrusively. With further development, this measure could be used to passively detect PT for deployment of “just-in-time” interventions.",,"Worry, Rumination (cognitive process), Major depression, Generalized anxiety disorder, Natural language processing, Machine learning"

Despite numerous studies on this preventable cause of death, the focus has primarily been on single nations and traditional statistical methods. Objective This study aims to develop a predictive model for adolescent suicidal thinking using multinational data sets and machine learning (ML). Methods We used data from the Korea Youth Risk Behavior Web-based Survey with 566,875 adolescents aged between 13 and 18 years and conducted external validation using the Youth Risk Behavior Survey with 103,874 adolescents and Norway’s University National General Survey with 19,574 adolescents. Several tree-based ML models were developed, and feature importance and Shapley additive explanations values were analyzed to identify risk factors for adolescent suicidal thinking. Results When trained on the Korea Youth Risk Behavior Web-based Survey data from South Korea with a 95% CI, the XGBoost model reported an area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve of 90.06% (95% CI 89.97-90.16), displaying superior performance compared to other models.

Are critical thinking and fluid intelligence distinct capabilities, or do they rely on similar cognitive processes? Extensive research indicates that executive functions, which govern the cognitive control of complex, goal-oriented behavior, play pivotal roles in both critical thinking and fluid intelligence. This current study delves into the degree of overlap between critical thinking and fluid intelligence, exploring how three frequently cited executive functions—updating, inhibition, and shifting—predict each of these faculties and their overlap. Data were gathered from a sample of 232 university students (142 female; Mage = 19.70, SD age = 1.22) on measures of critical thinking skills, critical thinking dispositions, fluid intelligence and executive functions. The findings reveal that fluid intelligence exhibits a significant association with both critical thinking skills (r = 0.62) and critical thinking dispositions (r = 0.31). Furthermore, the functions of updating and inhibition significantly contribute to both critical thinking skills and fluid intelligence, jointly explaining 85 % of their common variance. However, executive functions did not emerge as significant predictors of critical thinking dispositions.

Therefore, this paper integrates human thinking experience into actual collision avoidance decision-making to propose an intelligent collision avoidance model that is more in line with the operator ‘s understanding, thus improving trustworthiness and autonomy. The general architecture of collision avoidance model is divided into two modules: a basic model and an analytical model, by adopting from human thinking patterns of fast and slow. The basic model considers the COLREGS and navigation experience to solve the encounter situation of two ships. The analytical model addresses the collision avoidance issues in complex scenarios with multi-ships, by introducing the repulsive force and the driving force parts of the social force model, which are used to implement course mapping adjustment and gentle course fluctuation respectively. Additionally, a field theory-based effect evaluation model is designed to blend human experience with algorithmic benefits for making the optimal decision in complex scenarios. The results show that when the basic model and the analytical model work together, this architecture performs effectively in a variety of scenarios.

Yet whether Gc contributes to creativity beyond providing access to more knowledge, remains unclear. We explore the role of a “flexible” semantic memory network structure as a potential shared mechanism of Gc and creativity. Across two studies (N = 506 and N = 161) participants completed Gc tests of vocabulary knowledge and were divided into low, medium, and high Gc groups. They also completed two alternate uses task, to assess verbal creativity, and a semantic fluency task, to estimate semantic memory networks. Across both studies, the semantic memory network structure of the high Gc group was more flexible—less structured, more clustered, and more interconnected—than that of the low Gc group. The high Gc group also outperformed the low Gc group on the creativity tasks. Our results suggest that flexible access to semantic memory supports both verbal intelligence and creativity. Educational relevance statement Crystallized intelligence (Gc)—knowledge acquired through education and experience—supports creativity, yet whether Gc contributes to creativity beyond providing access to more knowledge (semantic memory), remains unclear. In this two-part study, we find that individuals with higher Gc tended to have a more flexible semantic memory structure, which in turn supported greater verbal creativity. This finding suggests that building students' vocabulary knowledge and verbal skills may not just expand their knowledge base, but also increase creativity through enabling more flexible access to that knowledge. If supported by further research, this could mean educational interventions targeting growth in Gc and semantic flexibility may foster students' creative capacities beyond just improving content mastery. Overall, this research highlights the interplay between building domain knowledge and cultivating creative thinking, suggesting educators should aim to develop both abilities in tandem rather than treating them separately.",,"Crystallized intelligence, Divergent thinking, Knowledge, Semantic network, Verbal creativity"

Systems thinking approaches are commonly used to understand emergent outcomes in complex systems. Systems thinking takes the system as the unit of analysis; often using a hierarchical representation to show how decisions and actions made across levels of a system (e.g., by governments, regulators, industry associations, companies, and individuals) can interact to create adverse outcomes. However, the extent to which rail suicide research has explored the problem from a systems thinking approach is unclear. A systematic review was conducted to identify: (1) the theories and methods that have been used to investigate rail suicide in the peer reviewed literature; (2) the contributory and demographic/risk factors for rail suicide identified across system levels; and (3) the preventative measures to address rail suicide that have been evaluated in published studies. The review followed the PRISMA guidelines and the systems thinking techniques AcciMap and PreventiMap were used to map factors and interventions across system levels. Gaps identified included a lack of consideration of contributory factors at higher system levels, that few preventative measures have been subject to evaluation, and that there has been little consideration of relationships between preventative measures.

Currently, many cross-cultural studies have focused on divergent thinking (DT) but lack evidence regarding convergent thinking (CT). In this review, we summary the cultural aspects of CT, specifically studies involving the Remote Associates Test (RAT), considering variations in RAT versions, thinking styles, and control strategies. Additionally, we performed summary from the brain activation patterns of C-RAT and E-RAT to support our propositions. We proposed a theoretical framework that differs from previous conclusions, which suggested that CT and DT are independent sub-components of creativity and that CT only benefits from persistence. Variations observed among different RAT sets may partially explain differences in creative performance. Western individuals benefit from a bias towards flexibility, facilitating the formation of more distant and weaker associations to promote CT. Eastern individuals, on the other hand, prioritize the usefulness of solutions and tend to engage in a holistic thinking style to foster CT. The common neural activation across cultures supports the partial reliance of CT on flexibility, while the additional activation observed only in E-RAT can be attributed to individual's cognitive effort to suppress close thoughts in order to form remote associations, and reach a unique solution by the evaluation of potential candidate ideas.",,"Convergent thinking, Creativity, RAT, Cultural differences"

In view of the high degree of required self-organization and decision-making skills that learning at the university demands, this ability seems relevant. In this study, 299 subjects completed four subtests on cognitive biases (cognitive reflection, resistance to belief bias, resistance to ratio bias, disjunctive reasoning). Bifactor analyses supported the existence of an underlying general factor of rational thinking processes as well as specific facet factors. Construct validity was analyzed with reaction times of correct and incorrect responses to test and control items. Among students (n = 191), rational thinking predicted academic success beyond fluid intelligence. The effect of rational thinking dispositions on academic success was partly mediated by rational thinking processes. Our results suggest that rational thinking is a general cognitive ability relevant to university learning, and they provide recommendations for its assessment.",,"Rationality, Academic achievement, Intelligence, Cognitive biases, University assessment"

However, students often lack innovative problem-solving skills when working with IT, and so new pedagogies are needed to improve IT-related curricula. Design thinking (DT), as a methodology, may offer the potential to meet this need. The present study developed a DT-based framework for the design of IT learning projects. A quasi-experiment was conducted in a junior middle school, employing both qualitative and quantitative analysis methods to explore the impact of DT on learning outcomes and mechanisms that explain the observed changes in student performance. The findings demonstrate that DT promotes creativity in students’ digital works, especially their value, diversity, and originality. DT also enhances students’ awareness of using IT to address daily challenges and facilitates their basic information knowledge and skills. Regarding the mechanisms, the DT process and tools serve as learning scaffolds and facilitate the creativity of digital work. The Ideate of DT generates ideas on what to do and how to do it. Empathize and Define establish a link between digital work and real-life problems. Prototype and Test help students acquire basic information knowledge and skills. This study not only examines the impact of DT on IT education but also explores the mechanisms to explain the observed changes in learning performance.

Experiment 1 compared the effects of mortality (endpoint) imagination with the imagination of being at age 70 and found that only mortality imagination significantly reduced delay discounting, the extent to which a delayed reward is discounted. In Experiment 2, mortality reminders companied by retrospective episodic mental time travel significantly reduced delay discounting compared to prospective episodic processing. However, the effect disappeared when the end-of-life reminder was replaced with an old-age (70 years) reminder.

Moreover, the complex characteristics of urban morphology and microenvironmental data at the street-block scale impact the speed of quantitative calculations of the energy demands of buildings. Intelligent spatial design workflows, driven by artificial intelligence tools and evolutionary algorithm-based self-feedback mechanisms, have been developed to address these issues. In constructing performance-driven simulation workflows for space generation, architectural simulations are influenced by model accuracy, boundary conditions, and application limitations. These problems have different solutions according to the study scope or focus; hence, the proposed solutions are specific and limited. Currently, numerical simulations in the design phase are based on detailed physical models such as EnergyPlus. However, existing algorithms are not tailored for data-driven generative design, which requires the quantification of limited information and has high computational costs, limiting the ability to balance simulation accuracy and computational costs. In this paper, bibliometric analysis is applied to systematically investigate the application of technical methods in energy consumption analyses in the early stage of architectural design. The applicability of forward- and reverse-simulation workflows in performance analyses of environmental systems is analyzed considering differences in the data flow direction. Additionally, considering the data limitations in the design phase, the accuracies of detailed physical models and simplified engineering models in performance-driven architectural space generation workflows are compared.

The semantic distance between these nouns is then calculated to indicate the person's level of divergent thinking. In this study, we explored the applicability of the DAT for elementary school students in Chinese contexts, given that it was not initially designed for this specific population and was available only in English. We recruited a total of 348 students who were asked to complete three creativity tasks: the DAT, the Alternative Uses Task (AUT), and the Bridge-the-Associative-Gap Task (BAG). We examined the associations between DAT and the scores of the AUT and BAG tests. Moreover, we tested the accuracy of the DAT using varying numbers of nouns and different natural language processing models to calculate the semantic distance between nouns. Our findings supported the suitability of using the DAT to measure divergent thinking in elementary school students within Chinese contexts. We also found that using only eight nouns, instead of ten, could achieve a relatively high accuracy in measuring divergent thinking based on the DAT method. The language model of Word2Vec performed better than the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) models when calculating semantic distances between nouns.

The method used in this study is the quasi-experiment method. In this study, researchers used learning with augmented reality to find its effect on student learning outcomes in grade 8 junior high school, which has an average age of 13 years. The research design used in this study was a quasi-experimental nonequivalent control group design. This study, 2 sample classes were taken: an experimental class (learning with augmented reality) and a control class (learning without augmented reality). The experimental and control classes have the same characteristics; each has 20 male and 20 female students. The instrument used in this research is a geometric thinking ability test. This study uses a test instrument in the form of essay questions. The instrument was given twice, namely during the pretest and post-test. There are ten essay questions made. After obtaining the data from the pretest and post-test results, the normalized gain score formula (N-Gain) was used to know the increase in geometric thinking skills. The N-Gain result of the experimental class is 78% or 0.78, which is in the high category. Whereas in the control class, it was 50% or 0.58, this result is in the moderate category. The N-gain results show that there is a difference between the experimental class and the control class. In this case, the effectiveness of using augmented reality for learning geometry in junior high school students is higher than those who did not receive augmented reality treatment. From the N-gain value, it proves that learning using augmented reality learning media is effective in increasing the ability to think Geometry. Then the results of observations made during learning activities using augmented reality show that students look active and make students more enthusiastic when learning Geometry. The results of the responses showed that 39 students had become more proactive in learning Geometry by using augmented reality applications.",,"augmented reality, thinking ability, geometry"

This study aims to explore the factors (e.g., gender, year of study, major, parents' educational level, family income, residence, and type of university) that potentially influence undergraduate students' CTD using PVs. This study involved 661 Chinese undergraduate students (female students represented 50.4%), utilizing the Employer–Employee–Supported Critical Thinking Disposition Inventory for data collection. After calculating PVs using item response theory, linear regression models through dummy variable regression on the PVs were conducted. The findings revealed that when the factors were examined individually, CTD may vary by type of university, year of study, parents’ educational level, and family income. However, when the factors were integrated into a comprehensive robust regression model, family income was identified as the unique factor influencing CTD, indicating that individuals from higher-income families exhibited higher CTD levels than students from lower-income families. Demographic factors accounted for 5%–10% of the variation. Future research should investigate additional factors that may substantially impact on college students’ CTD.

For a common test of DT, the Alternate Uses Task (AUT), the primary automated approach casts the problem as a semantic distance between a prompt and the resulting idea in a text model. This work presents an alternative approach that greatly surpasses the performance of the best existing semantic distance approaches. Our system, Ocsai, fine-tunes deep neural network-based large-language models (LLMs) on human-judged responses. Trained and evaluated against one of the largest collections of human-judged AUT responses, with 27 thousand responses collected from nine past studies, our fine-tuned large-language-models achieved up to r = 0.81 correlation with human raters, greatly surpassing current systems (r = 0.12–0.26). Further, learning transfers well to new test items and the approach is still robust with small numbers of training labels. We also compare prompt-based zero-shot and few-shot approaches, using GPT-3, ChatGPT, and GPT-4. This work also suggests a limit to the underlying assumptions of the semantic distance model, showing that a purely semantic approach that uses the stronger language representation of LLMs, while still improving on existing systems, does not achieve comparable improvements to our fine-tuned system. The increase in performance can support stronger applications and interventions in DT and opens the space of automated DT scoring to new areas for improving and understanding this branch of methods.",,"Divergent thinking, Alternate uses test, Large-language models, Automated scoring"

Recently, a new measure of associative cognition has been developed—forward flow—which uses computational semantic models (e.g., latent semantic analysis; LSA) to capture “how far” people travel in semantic space during a chained free association task. The present research aims to extend the psychometrics of forward flow by 1) leveraging multiple computational semantic models for forward flow computation (reliability) and 2) testing how this metric of associative ability relates to divergent creative thinking (validity). In addition, using structural equation modeling, we test dual-process theories of creative cognition by examining the relative contribution of associative and executive abilities to divergent thinking.

The findings revealed: a) broad positioning of the terms in the European Union; b) open access and open data as current driving themes; c) a constant trade-off between the terms “open data” and “information protection”; d) lack of studies on researchers’ complex thinking to help them manage openness; e) absence of the environmental helix in the initiatives; and (f) challenges in innovative communication and collaborative practices among public and private entities. Overall, we identified an opportunity to develop researchers’ complex thinking such that the openness of information becomes a shared responsibility among partners across multiple helices. This shared responsibility can have methodological implications that permeate how open science and open innovation are theorized and, in practice, facilitate the development of fundamental collaborative research procedures.",,"Open innovation, Open science, Complex thinking, Ecosystems, Research enhancement, Educational innovation, Higher education"

Within generating ideas from a similar conceptual (semantic) category, memory retrieval can cause fixation through output interference, leading to fewer novel ideas. However, an incubation interval or new context can facilitate such a memory retrieval process, thus leading to the generation of more novel ideas. Proactive inhibition (PI), a phenomenon rooted in memory research, disrupts the retrieval of new learning due to prior experiences. Release from Proactive Inhibition (RPI) involves a memory rebound when switching between semantic categories, leading to an increase in the semantic distance between responses and the release of semantic inhibitory. While PI has been well-studied in memory research, it has rarely been examined in creativity research. Two experiments were conducted to investigate how PI and RPI influence creative ideation. Experiment 1 explored whether the RPI effect occurs in the Alternate Use Task (AUT), with a control group using the same semantic categories and an experiment group using different semantic categories when generating AUT responses. The results showed that PI inhibited the generation of creative ideas in the control group, while RPI in the experimental group led to an increase in generating original and unique ideas, influencing indicators such as repetitive rate, originality, and uniqueness. Additionally, larger semantic distances of responses from the cue resulted in greater RPI and more original ideas. Experiment 2 manipulated semantic distance across three levels (baseline, close, and remote distance groups) to explore whether the degree of semantic distance influences the amount of RPI in creative ideation. The results indicated that in the remote distance group, RPI affected repetitive rate, originality, and uniqueness, but the magnitude of RPI did not significantly differ between the close and remote distance groups. These findings suggest that the occurrence of RPI offers new insights into the process and theoretical explanation of creative ideation.",,"Creativity, Divergent thinking, Release from proactive inhibition, Semantic distance, AUT"

Building on the learning theory of Constructionism, this intervention study used a curriculum intervention program, “Making a Makerspace” (MM), to integrate the makerspace into Chinese kindergartens. We used a quasi-experimental research design to evaluate the effects of this curriculum intervention, with 120 children enrolled in the experimental classrooms, while the other 111 children enrolled in the waitlist control classrooms. Teacher-report child performance (N = 231) showed that the MM program resulted in significantly higher scores in children's STEM habits of mind in the intervention group, relative to the control group. Analyses of parent-report child behaviors revealed that there was a significant effect of the MM program on post-intervention temperamental surgency. Our evidence shows that such a scalable program encourages and guides teachers to build a positive learning environment for supporting young children's making and thinking in everyday preschool experiences.

First, we review evidence that impairments in episodic memory and future thinking co-occur, and that both abilities rely on the default mode network. We discuss recent findings showing that episodic memory details are retrieved in service of future simulation, including evidence that modulating access to episodic details alters future simulation, and that multivoxel patterns of hippocampal activity can decode specific details comprising future simulations.

Moreover, there are crucial limitations of previous approaches for addressing the sustainability challenge of the energy sector. Changing, transforming, and integrating paradigms are the most relevant leverage points for transforming a given system. In other words, nowadays the integration of new predominant paradigms in order to provide a unified framework could aim at this actual transformation looking for a sustainable future. This research aims to develop a new unified framework for the integration of the following three paradigms: (1) Sustainability, (2) Complexity, and (3) Systems Thinking which will be applied to achieving sustainable energy production (using hydrogen production as a case study). The novelty of this work relies on providing a holistic perspective through the integration of the aforementioned paradigms considering the multiple and complex interdependencies among the economy, the environment, and the economy. For this purpose, an integrated seven-stage approach is introduced which explores from the starting point of the integration of paradigms to the application of this integration to sustainable energy production. After applying the Three-Paradigm approach for sustainable hydrogen production as a case study, 216 feedback loops are identified, due to the emerged complexity linked to the analyzed system. Additionally, three system dynamics-based models are developed (by increasing the level of complexity) as part of the application of the Three-Paradigm approach. This research can be of interest to a broad professional audience (e.g. engineers, policymakers) as looks into the sustainability of the energy sector from a holistic perspective, considering a newly developed Three-Paradigm model considering complexity and using a Systems Thinking approach.",,"Systems thinking, Sustainability, Complexity, Sustainable hydrogen production, Causal loop diagram, System dynamics"

Design-by-Analogy promotes divergent thinking, by studying solutions have solved similar problems and using this knowledge to make inferences and solve problems in new and unfamiliar situations. Bio-inspired design (BID) is a form of design by analogy and its knowledge provides diverse sources for analogy, making BID knowledge as a potential source for divergent thinking. Existing BID database has focused on collecting BID cases and facilitating the retrieval of biological knowledge. Despite its success, applying BID knowledge into divergent thinking still encounters challenge, as the association between source domain and target domain are always limited within a single case. In this work, a novel approach is proposed to support divergent thinking from three subsequent phases: encoding, retrieval and mapping. Specifically, biological knowledge is encoded in a triple form by employing a large language model (LLM) to extract key information from a well-known BID knowledge base. The created triples are implemented in a semantic network to facilitate bidirectional retrieval modes: problem-driven and solution-driven, as well as mapping for divergent thinking. The mapping algorithm calculates the semantic similarity between nodes in the semantic network based on their attributes in three progressive steps by following the paradigm of divergent thinking. The proposed approach is implemented as tool called AskNatureNet,11https://www.asknaturenet.com/. which supports divergent thinking by retrieving and mapping knowledge in a visualized interactive semantic network. An ideation case study on evaluating the effectiveness of AskNatureNet shows that our tool is capable of supporting divergent thinking efficiently.",,"Bio-inspired design, Semantic network, Divergent thinking, Design creativity, Design ideation"

The present research is the first randomized controlled trial investigating the effect of a novel thinking disposition intervention (TDI)—a 7-week educational curriculum—on cognitive reflection performance. In the present study, participants (N = 338) were randomized to either the TDI or a control condition. A Bayesian modeling approach suggests positive and moderate effects. Moreover, those in the treatment were over twice as likely to make CRT gains than those in the control group. Additional mediation and moderation analyses were conducted to test whether the TDI impacts CRT via thinking dispositions such as need for cognition and intellectual humility, and/or whether such attributes meaningfully interact with the intervention. Thinking dispositions do not appear to mediate this relationship, neither do they moderate the effect of the intervention.

A total of 4847 secondary school English learners (Mage = 15.579, SD = 0.546) from China participated in the research, with 46.1 % males and 53.9 % females. Data was collected through self-reported scales measuring perceived teacher enthusiasm, CT dispositions, and WTC. Findings revealed a positive association between CT dispositions and WTC, identifying systematicity, self-confidence in reasoning, inquisitiveness, and cognitive maturity as significant predictors of WTC. Moreover, teacher enthusiasm was found to positively moderate the relationship between CT dispositions and WTC. Additionally, high levels of teacher enthusiasm boosted WTC more significantly for students with high CT dispositions, and this effect was stronger for females than for males. This research carries significant implications for FL teaching, suggesting that fostering teacher enthusiasm and reinforcing CT dispositions could significantly elevate learners’ communicative willingness and overall language proficiency.",,"Teacher enthusiasm, Critical thinking dispositions, Willingness to communicate, Gender difference"

The process by which this effect operates, however, remains unclear. Do accuracy prompts cause people to “stop and think,” increasing deliberation? Or do they change what people think about, drawing attention to accuracy? Since these two accounts predict the same behavioral outcomes (i.e., increased sharing discernment following a prompt), we used computational modeling of sharing decisions with response time data, as well as out-of-sample ratings of headline perceived accuracy, to test the accounts' divergent predictions across six studies (N = 5633). The results suggest that accuracy prompts do not increase the amount of deliberation people engage in. Instead, they increase the weight participants put on accuracy while deliberating. By showing that prompting people makes them think better even without thinking more, our results challenge common dual-process interpretations of the accuracy-prompt effect.

We argue that systems-thinking, One Health approaches are crucial for tackling AMR, by understanding and predicting how anthropogenic activities interact within environmental subsystems, to drive AMR emergence and transmission. Innovative computational methods integrating big data streams (eg, from clinical, agricultural, and environmental monitoring) will accelerate our understanding of AMR, supporting decision making. There are challenges to accessing, integrating, synthesising, and interpreting such complex, multidimensional, heterogeneous datasets, including the lack of specific metrics to quantify anthropogenic AMR. Moreover, data confidentiality, geopolitical and cultural variation, surveillance gaps, and science funding cause biases, uncertainty, and gaps in AMR data and metadata. Combining systems-thinking with modelling will allow exploration, scaling-up, and extrapolation of existing data. This combination will provide vital understanding of the dynamic movement and transmission of AMR within and among environmental subsystems, and its effects across the greater system. Consequently, strategies for slowing down AMR dissemination can be modelled and compared for efficacy and cost-effectiveness.",,

Traditional skill learning methods cannot meet this demand, while complex learning can adapt to this demand for talent. In complex learning systems, various factors such as instructional theory, instructional interventions, and technology work together to facilitate the acquisition of complex thinking or operational skills. However, the effectiveness of instructional factors in complex skills learning remains unknown. To find out the effects of these factors on the acquisition of different complex skills, this meta-analysis includes 60 empirical studies and the effectiveness of 4C/ID model, instructional interventions and technical support on different complex learning are investigated. Complex skills learning had a moderate positive overall effect in acquiring complex skills: g = 0.67, 95% CI [0.49, 0.85]. Both thinking skills (g = 0.69, 95% CI [0.44, 0.94], k = 40) and operational skills (g = 0.64, 95% CI [0.38, 0.89], k = 20) showed moderate positive effects, and there was small but not statistically significant difference in the effect sizes between the two groups. Funnel plot, Egger's test and Rank Correlation Test results show that the findings were likely not to be affected by publication bias. We conclude that: compared to traditional learning, (1) the 4C/ID model is more suitable for thinking skills learning and has a significant large positive promotion effect. (2) Different instructional interventions can play a positive role in promoting the learning of complex skills. Learning scaffolding and learning platforms and tools are more suitable for operational skills learning, while thinking skills learning can benefit more from the adjustment of instructional models. (3) A variety of technologies can have a high effect on facilitating complex thinking and operational skills. These results show that different instructional interventions and technical support play a vital role in the learning of complex skills.

Accurate and reliable segmentation for pancreas and pancreatic cancer on computerized tomography (CT) images is vital in clinical diagnosis and treatment. Although certain deep learning-based techniques have been tentatively applied to this task, current performance of pancreatic cancer segmentation is far from meeting the clinical needs due to the tiny size, irregular shape and extremely uncertain boundary of the cancer. Besides, most of the existing studies are established on the black-box models which only learn the annotation distribution instead of the logical thinking and diagnostic experience of high-level medical experts, the latter is more credible and interpretable. To alleviate the above issues, we propose a novel Segment-Like-A-Doctor (SLAD) framework to learn the reliable clinical thinking and experience for pancreas and pancreatic cancer segmentation on CT images. Specifically, SLAD aims to simulate the essential logical thinking and experience of doctors in the progressive diagnostic stages of pancreatic cancer: organ, lesion and boundary stage. Firstly, in the organ stage, an Anatomy-aware Masked AutoEncoder (AMAE) is introduced to model the doctors’ overall cognition for the anatomical distribution of abdominal organs on CT images by self-supervised pretraining. Secondly, in the lesion stage, a Causality-driven Graph Reasoning Module (CGRM) is designed to learn the global judgment of doctors for lesion detection by exploring topological feature difference between the causal lesion and the non-causal organ. Finally, in the boundary stage, a Diffusion-based Discrepancy Calibration Module (DDCM) is developed to fit the refined understanding of doctors for uncertain boundary of pancreatic cancer by inferring the ambiguous segmentation discrepancy based on the trustworthy lesion core. Experimental results on three independent datasets demonstrate that our approach boosts pancreatic cancer segmentation accuracy by 4%–9% compared with the state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, the tumor-vascular involvement analysis is also conducted to verify the superiority of our method in clinical applications.

It employed a microethnography to provide nuanced observations of five young children's (aged 4–5 years) interactions and behaviours. Data was collected through approximately 40 hours of video recordings, capturing the dynamic and multimodal aspects of the childrenʼs play and learning experiences. A multimodal interaction analysis was used to examine the multimodal design affordances of each device as mapped against Murcia et al.'s (2020) A-E of Creativity Framework. The findings revealed a clear interplay between digital technologies and various modes of communication, with children demonstrating creativity through their verbal expressions, manipulation of the devices, and spatial understanding of their physical environment. By understanding the multimodal affordances of digital devices aligned with educational frameworks and embracing child-specific definitions of creativity, educators, curriculum designers, policymakers, and researchers can collectively promote creativity and enrich digital learning and play for young children.",,"Creativity, Digital technology, Early years learning, Multimodality"

Many organizations use video games in the fields of education, marketing, business, and entrepreneurship. This research aimed to investigate the role of video games in enhancing managers' strategic thinking and their potential contribution to developing cognitive capabilities. The sample included 30 students actively involved in the innovation and entrepreneurship ecosystem. To measure the strategic thinking of the participants, Pisapia’s strategic thinking questionnaire was used, and the CANTAB test was employed to measure their cognitive capabilities. To identify the individuals’ game-playing styles, indicators of micro-management, planning, plan recognition, predictions, gathering resources, partial observability, and damage avoidance were designed. The findings indicated that 53.3 percent of the participants had reflective thinking, 30 percent had systems thinking, and the rest had a reframing thinking style as their strategic thinking dominant dimension. On the other hand, given the identified correlation between the damage avoidance criteria with the thinking and reflective style, as well as the inverse and significant correlation of the gathering resources criteria with the results of the PRM test, it seems that strategic games have the potential to change and even develop some cognitive functions such as attention, reaction, and memory, and can be considered as tools to improve cognitive ability. These games can be used to design tasks to enhance managers' cognitive abilities and subsequently promote their strategic thinking and decision-making skills.",,"Strategic thinking, Video games, Cognitive enhancement, Management, Entrepreneurial behavior, Artificial intelligence"

This approach can also stimulate critical thinking, as it requires active student participation in debates, analysis, and discussions. The purpose of this study is to determine the impact of interactive learning on Zoom on the anxiety, emotional well-being, and critical thinking of college students. The experiment involved 80 college students between 18 and 21 years of age. The research was performed by scientists from the [Zhengzhou University of Technology] University. To analyze the impact of the proposed strategy on emotional and cognitive well-being, the study used a set of questionnaires, namely Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale, WAM (Well-being Assessment Measure), and Subjective Questionnaire for assessing critical thinking. The obtained results confirm the effectiveness of the interactive learning methodology, which significantly reduced anxiety and increased the level of critical thinking among students. Anxiety decreased by 14 points, and critical thinking improved by 2.5 points, indicating positive dynamics of psychological and cognitive development. Despite the positive results, some contextual factors such as the level of the learning environment, cultural characteristics, and the personalities of students can influence the generalization of the findings. These findings can have practical application in the pedagogical practice of creating a favorable learning environment. Future research may focus on improving the methodology of interactive learning, studying its impact on other aspects of learning and development. It is also necessary to explore the use of interactive learning in various cultural and educational contexts.",,"Anxiety and depression, Cognitive and social skills, Emotional state of students, Interactive methods in education, Online learning"

Another aim was to demonstrate the integration of a data-driven and activity-based GHG emissions model for individuals into the framework to enable decarbonisation. This model was populated using individual activity and lifestyle data which were collected for 172 people using a smartphone application. The resulting emissions drivers were identified as well as their interaction with the overarching urban decarbonisation framework. The research will have important implications in terms of informing emissions mitigation efforts at individual, community and urban scales.

These frameworks offer a robust methodology for tackling complex, dynamic, and interconnected challenges—referred to as “wicked problems”. In addition, this paper proposes a fourth-year engineering design course that explicitly incorporates these approaches, addressing the identified gap in social competencies within engineering education.

We examined whether this persistency of negative thinking is related to current and future levels of depressive symptoms among adolescents. Persistency of negative self-referent thinking was assessed by means of a decision-making task, namely the emotional reversal learning task. This task offers participants the choice between thinking about negative and positive self-related aspects. Their choice for negative self-referent thinking is initially rewarded but is later punished. Therefore, participants were expected to efficiently switch between negative and positive self-referent thinking, and to internally update their reward expectancy for these thinking options. Results showed that persistency of negative self-referent thinking was related to concurrent levels of depressive symptoms, replicating earlier findings in adults. However, persistency of negative thinking was unrelated to future levels of depressive symptoms. These findings suggest that adolescents with depressive symptoms tend to hold on to the belief that negative self-referent thinking has beneficial consequences, even when it is no longer being rewarded. This tendency should be seen as a concurrent feature of depression, as the predictive value is still in question.",,"Adolescent psychopathology, Depression, Reversal learning, Computational reinforcement learning, Cognitive processes, Information processing, Learning theory"

Network science tools have recently been applied to map the organization of concepts in semantic memory, and to study the link between semantic memory and creativity. Yet such work has largely overlooked the domain of convergent thinking, despite the theoretical importance of semantic memory networks for facilitating associative processes relevant for convergent problem solving (e.g., spreading activation). Convergent thinking problems, such as the Compound Remote Associates (CRA) test, can be solved with insight (the sudden “aha” experience) or analysis (deliberately and incrementally working towards the solution). In a sample of 477 participants, we adopted network science methods to compare semantic memory structure across two grouping variables: 1) convergent thinking ability (i.e., CRA accuracy), and 2) the self-reported tendency to solve problems with insight or analysis. Semantic memory networks were constructed from a semantic fluency task, and problem solving style (insight or analysis) was determined from judgments provided during solving of CRAs. We found that, compared to the low-convergent thinking group, the high-convergent thinking group exhibited a more flexible and interconnected semantic network—with short paths and many connections between concepts. Moreover, participants who primarily solved problems with insight (compared to analysis) showed shorter average path distances between concepts, even after controlling for accuracy. Our results extend the literature on semantic memory and creativity, and suggest that the organization of semantic memory plays a key role in convergent thinking, including insight problem solving.",,"Convergent thinking, Insight, Problem solving, Remote associates test, Semantic networks"

Dysfunction in executive functioning processes, particularly the ability to regulate the contents of working memory, are implicated in the development and maintenance of RNT. Guided by the National Institute of Mental Health experimental therapeutics framework, this study aimed to investigate the cognitive effects and effects of two doses of a novel working memory training (WMT) intervention in individuals with elevated RNT across mood, anxiety, and traumatic stress disorders. We conducted a three-arm randomized controlled trial with 8-session and 16-session WMT interventions and a waitlist control group (N = 73). Our primary goal was to establish target engagement of WMT as measured by behavioral and neural indicators of working memory performance. Results revealed that WMT significantly improved working memory performance and resulted in reduced frontoparietal neural activity during a working memory task compared to the waitlist control group, providing evidence of target engagement. Exploratory analyses revealed a potential transfer of training effects to fluid intelligence, a construct related to but distinct from working memory, suggesting broader cognitive benefits of WMT. These data provide evidence that WMT can enhance working memory performance in individuals with RNT. This intervention holds promise as a transdiagnostic approach for ameliorating RNT-related clinical burden, with the 8-session regimen showing pragmatic advantages. Further research is needed to elucidate its impact on clinical symptoms and explore potential cognitive benefits beyond working memory.",,"Cognitive training, Working memory, Executive functioning, Repetitive negative thinking, Internalizing disorders"

Unsupervised learning models posit that memories are adjusted based on how strongly these representations are coactivated during the retrieval process. From a different perspective, clinical models of addiction posit that the escalation and persistence of craving may depend on desire thinking, a thinking style orienting to prefigure information about positive addiction-related experiences. In the present work, we tested the main hypothesis that desire thinking is a key factor in the strengthening of addiction-related associations. A group of adult smoking volunteers (N = 26) engaged in a period of desire thinking before performing an associative learning task in which neutral words (cues) were shown along with images (smoking-related vs. neutral context) at different frequencies. Two retrieval tests were administered, one immediately after encoding and the other after 24 h, to test how the recall of associations changed as a function of retention interval. Two control groups, smokers (N = 21) and non-smokers (N = 22), performed a similar procedure, with a neutral imagination task replacing desire thinking. Participants who engaged in desire thinking increased their performance from the first to the second retrieval test only for the most frequent smoking-related associations. Crucially, this selective effect was not observed in the two control groups. These results provide behavioral evidence in support of the idea that desire thinking plays a role in strengthening addiction-related associations. Thus, this thinking process may be considered a target for reconsolidation-based conceptualizations of, and treatments for, addiction.",,"Addictive behaviors, Associative memory, Desire thinking, Reconsolidation, Unsupervised learning"

Our goal was to map which skills are commonly examined in kindergarten and under which terminology as well as to investigate the studies' features, the types of robotics, and the assessment tools utilized.

It should also be emphasized that the phase of the wave function of a particle is inextricably linked with the quantum action S in the Feynman’s formulation of quantum mechanics (path integrals). A hypothesis is proposed: the set of particles that make up neurons and the brain is controlled by changing the phases from the outside (by a higher order system). Such a control system must be outside our world because our measurement methods do not allow us to determine the phase of an elementary particle.

Despite its widespread impact, stigma associated with HBV significantly hinders access to testing, diagnosis, and treatment. This study investigates the relationship between HBV stigma and cognitive distortions among individuals living with HBV by analyzing 35,697 posts from Yiyou Forum, China's largest HBV online community. Utilizing a large language model (LLM) for stigma classification, posts were categorized into stigma-related (S-posts) and non-stigma-related (N-posts). A schema comprising 235 n-grams was employed to identify 12 types of cognitive distortions within these posts. Statistical analyses revealed that S-posts had a prevalence ratio (PR) of 1.824 (95%CI [1.636, 2.074]) for cognitive distortions compared to N-posts, indicating that distorted thinking patterns were approximately 1.8 times more common in stigma-related discussions. Specific distortions such as disqualifying the positive, labeling and mislabeling, mental filtering, and should statements were significantly more prevalent in S-posts. User-level analysis confirmed that individuals engaging in stigma-related posts consistently displayed higher levels of cognitive distortions.

Results suggested that the career personality styles (i.e. social, enterprising) that fit the vocational environment of kindergarten teaching the most positively predicted the students' career adaptability, both directly and indirectly through creativity-generating thinking styles. Moreover, the artistic and investigative career personality styles indirectly predicted students' career adaptability through creativity-generating thinking styles, while the conventional and realistic career personality styles showed no significant effect on the students' career adaptability. The findings imply that beyond the notion of person-environment congruence, some career personality styles can consistently predict career adaptability through thinking styles.

What drives excessive and maladaptive teleological thinking? In causal learning, there is a fundamental distinction between associative learning versus learning via propositional mechanisms. Here, we propose that directly contrasting the contributions of these two pathways can elucidate the roots of excess teleology. We modified a causal learning task such that we could encourage associative versus propositional mechanisms in different instances. Across three experiments (total N = 600), teleological tendencies were correlated with delusion-like ideas and uniquely explained by aberrant associative learning, but not by learning via propositional rules. Computational modeling suggested that the relationship between associative learning and teleological thinking can be explained by excessive prediction errors that imbue random events with more significance — providing a new understanding for how humans make meaning of lived events.",,"Health sciences, Human activity in medical context, Association analysis"

However, research on DT in K-12 education has not yet been comprehensively reviewed. The current review research attempted to bridge this gap in the field. Following the PRISMA guidelines, this review examined 40 empirical studies on DT in K-12 education, with specific emphasis on four key aspects: (1) research areas, (2) incorporation of DT into K-12 education, (3) methodologies, and (4) reported findings in reviewed studies. In terms of the first aspect, the main themes to analyze were identified as participant perspective, instructional intervention, learning assessment, and design mechanism. In terms of the second aspect, it was found that studies were conducted primarily in the context of design, technology, engineering, and STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) education in middle schools and durations ranging from three days to nine weeks. In terms of the third aspect, these studies typically carried out qualitative analysis of documents and administered questionnaires, interviews, and observations. The articles described the development of questionnaires, online games, and scales to evaluate DT. In terms of the fourth aspect, the findings showed that DT was welcomed by most participants, and it was capable of optimizing learning processes and helped promote student learning. DT can be developed not only through DT courses but also through programming learning. The effective way to DT was explained through time allocation, modalities, and iteration sequence exploration. Based on the findings, it may be concluded that DT is still in an early development stage in K-12 education, and so research on DT has not yet been broadly established with academic content learning. More studies on subject content learning supported by various DT elements, instruction based on design mechanisms, and technology-supported assessment in K-12 education are needed to impact the educational practice of DT.",,"Elementary education, Secondary education, Design thinking, Teaching/learning strategies"
JOUR,Intuition or rationality: Impact of critical thinking dispositions on the cognitive processing of creative information,"Zhang, Yan, Bian, Yueran, Wu, Huifen, Tang, Weichu, Li, Qi",2023,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tsc.2023.101278,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1871187123000482,"Creative thinking and critical thinking complement each other and are inseparable. The two fold model theory of creativity believes that the generation of creative thinking includes two processes: concept generation and concept evaluation. Among them, individuals will rely more on non-automatic top-down control processing for cognitive information processing in the process of concept evaluation. Critical thinking belongs to analytical thinking, which focuses on and doubts the information bias in the generation of ideas to restrain. Therefore, this study assumes that the impact of critical thinking on creative thinking will occur in the process of concept evaluation, which is rational judgment rather than intuitive thinking. This study uses event-related potential (ERP) techniques to explore the explicit and implicit mechanisms of cognitive processing of creative information (i.e. role of intuition and rationality) in people with different critical thinking dispositions. The current study includes two experiments. Experiment 1 is an explicit ERP experiment, which uses a priming paradigm to examine the neural mechanisms underlying the explicit processing of creative information by individuals with different critical thinking dispositions. Experiment 2 is an implicit ERP experiment, which uses an alternative Stroop paradigm to examine the neural mechanisms underlying the implicit processing of creative information. Results found that the brain mechanisms of explicit cognition of creative information differed significantly across critical thinking dispositions. For low-critical thinking dispositions, low-creative characters evoked larger N1 waves than high-creative characters initiation conditions. For high-critical thinking dispositions, high-creative words evoked larger P2 waves than low-creative words. However, implicit cognition did not differ significantly. This result suggests that the cognitive processing of creative information by different critical thinkers is a rational thought process. The N1 and P2 components, which are indicators of cognitive sensitivity to creative information, can be used as markers to distinguish among different critical thinking dispositions.",,"Critical thinking disposition, Creativity, N1, P2"

Consequently, the direct study of work processes necessitates our attention. However, organizational scholars tend not to study work processes directly. Instead, organizational scholars commonly develop theories about relationships among psychological construct phenomena that indirectly reference people’s affective, behavioral, cognitive, and/or social processes as underlying explanations. Specifically, construct-oriented theories summarize processes in operation across actors, time, and contexts, and thus, provide limited insights into how focal phenomena manifest directly as a function of process operations. Construct theories remain one-step removed from articulating sequences of actions and two-steps removed from describing generative mechanisms responsible for observed actions. By “missing the action,” construct theories offer incomplete explanatory accounts and imprecise interventions. We assert that researchers in organizational science can make progress towards addressing these concerns by directing greater attention to developing computational process theories. We begin by presenting a framework for differentiating theories based on their focus (constructs versus processes) and modality (narrative versus computational). We use the framework to contrast narrative construct theories to computational process theories. We then describe key design principles for developing computational process theories and explain those principles using a leadership example. We use simulated data, from the computational process model we develop, to explicitly demonstrate the differences between construct and process thinking. We then discuss how computational process theories advance theory development. We conclude with a discussion of the long-term benefits of computational process theories for organizational science.",,"Computational process theories, Generative mechanisms, Process thinking, Process explanations, Organizational science"

Electrocardiogram (ECG)-based detection and localization of myocardial infarction is susceptible to individual patient differences. We propose a new deep learning model to improve the detection and localization performance on different patient data. Methods: To address these issues, we propose SRTNet, a novel model with scanning, reading, and thinking modules, for MI detection and localization. The model learns ECG features from three different perspectives, namely, the scanning module for learning 12-lead ECG features, the reading module for learning the correlation features of different leads, and the thinking module for learning temporal dimension features. The model learned features contain both temporal and spatial ones that can alleviate overfitting individual differences. Results: In the experiments, we used 5-fold cross-validation in the PTB dataset to demonstrate the performance of SRTNet. The results show that SRTNet achieves the state-of-the-art performance. For detection performance, the accuracy is 99.25%, the sensitivity is 99.15%, the specificity is 98.58%, and the F1 score is 99.09%. For localization performance, the accuracy is 68.45%, the sensitivity is 61.82%, the specificity is 67.95% , and the F1 score is 60.50%. Conclusion: The experimental results show that SRTNet’s multi-level feature learning method can detect and locate MI more accurately.

Assessing HOTS can increase students’ awareness of their cognitive abilities and promote the development of advanced cognitive skills. This study proposes an automated assessment approach for HOTS, to overcome the limitations of existing methods that rely on experts and are often short-term. The exceptional knowledge base and advanced reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have prompted academics to extend their application to various areas, where they outperform models limited to specific domains. Inspired by this, we propose a framework for the automated assessment of HOTS using LLMs, called LLM4HA. The framework consists of two distinct models: a text-based exercise classification model constructed from pre-trained BERT, and a student HOTS assessment model based on response data, constructed by fine-tuning pre-trained LLMs. To validate the performance of our framework, we established a classification rule based on Bloom’s taxonomy for exercise classification. We collected 43,070 exercise data points from 181 undergraduate students, from which exercise text data and response data were obtained. The results demonstrate that LLM4HA successfully classifies exercises and assesses students’ HOTS. The BERT-based classification model outperforms ChatGPT-4, and the LLMs-based fine-tuning model significantly outperforms the RNNs-based model. A comprehensive analysis was conducted to identify the causes of this outcome. The findings indicate that the robust knowledge base and sophisticated architecture may be crucial for achieving optimal performance in the HOTS assessment task.

Implementing adequate online pedagogical approaches and integrating different digital tools in the teaching process have become a priority in educational systems. Finding a way to keep students' interest and persistence in learning is an important issue that online education is facing. One possible way to establish engaging and interactive learning environments, using the energy and enthusiasm of students for educational purposes, is the use of game-based learning activities and gamification of different parts of the educational process. Objective This paper presents a use case of migrating an escape room–style educational game to an online environment by using the design thinking methodology. We wanted to show that the design thinking methodology is useful to create engaging and motivating online games that provide educational value. Methods Starting from students’ perspective, we created a simple digital escape room–style game where students got an opportunity to self-assess their knowledge in computer science at their own pace. Students tested this prototype game, and their opinions about the game were collected through an online survey. The test's goal was to evaluate the students' perceptions about the implemented digital escape room–style educational game and gather information about whether it could achieve students' engagement in learning computer science during online teaching. Results In total, 117 students from sixth and seventh grades completed the survey regarding the achieved student engagement. Despite the differences in students’ answers about game complexity and puzzle difficulty, most students liked the activity (mean 4.75, SD 0.67, on a scale from 1 to 5). They enjoyed the game, and they would like to participate in this kind of activity again (mean 4.74, SD 0.68). All (n=117, 100%) students found the digital escape room–style educational game interesting for playing and learning. Conclusions The results confirmed that digital escape room–style games could be used as an educational tool to engage students in the learning process and achieve learning outcomes. Furthermore, the design thinking methodology proved to be a useful tool in the process of adding novel educational value to the digital escape room–style game.",,"digital games, escape room, computational thinking, gamification, students’ engagement, interactive learning environments, serious games, digital health, education, student education, learning outcomes, digital learning, digital education, educational games"

By integrating technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, virtual reality (VR), and augmented reality (AR), the metaverse presents considerable potential for creating customized teaching environments and promoting situated learning. However, current research on the Metaverse Teaching Scene (MTS) primarily involves qualitative discussions, lacking empirical evidence on how MTS influences students' creative thinking and collaborative intentions. This study, grounded in Situated Learning Theory and the Stimuli-Organism-Response (S-O-R) paradigm, explores the factors that affect students' creative thinking and collaborative intentions within MTS. Data were gathered from 316 Chinese university students through questionnaires and analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM) and artificial neural networks (ANN). The results indicate that contextual cognition factors (e.g., immersion, learning motivation, interactive experience, perceived incentives) in MTS enhance students' self-efficacy and emotional responses, which in turn foster creative thinking and collaborative intentions. Moreover, the study reveals that self-efficacy positively mediates the association between emotions and creative thinking.

Algorithmic thinking refers to the ability to analyse a problem and develop a step-by-step process to solve it. This research investigates the efficacy of the Cross Array Task (CAT) as an assessment tool for AT skills within Switzerland’s compulsory education system. Originally conceptualised as an unplugged activity, where students performed the task without digital technologies (e.g., by using gestures on paper) and an administrator manually assessed them, the CAT evolved into a digital activity that runs on an iPad. The CAT’s digital transformation has automated the scoring of student responses and data collection, streamlining the assessment processes and facilitating efficient large-scale assessments. It has also enhanced scalability, making the CAT suitable for widespread use in educational settings. Furthermore, it provides immediate feedback to students and educators, supporting timely interventions and personalised learning experiences. Our study aims to comprehensively investigate algorithmic competencies in compulsory education, examining their variations and influencing factors. This research examines key variables, such as age, sex, educational environment and school characteristics (e.g., the level and grade of education), and regional factors (e.g., the canton of the school) in Switzerland, and characteristics related to the specific assessment tool, including the type of artefact used, the complexity of the algorithms generated, and the level of autonomy. Additionally, it seeks to analyse the effectiveness of the unplugged and digital approaches in assessing AT skills, specifically comparing the unplugged and virtual CAT versions, aiming to provide insights into their advantages and potential synergies. This investigation delineates the developmental progression of AT skills across compulsory education, emphasising the influence of age on algorithm development and problem-solving strategies. Furthermore, we reveal the impact of artefacts and the potential of digital tools to facilitate advanced AT skill development across diverse age groups. Finally, our investigation delves into the influence of school environments and sex disparities on AT performance, alongside the significant individual variability influenced by personal abilities and external circumstances. These findings underscore the importance of tailored educational interventions and equitable practices to accommodate diverse learning profiles and optimise student outcomes in AT across educational settings.",,"Teaching/learning strategies, 21st century abilities, Evaluation methodologies, Elementary education, Secondary education"

This requires the application of prospective scenario analyses to develop the baseline scenario, reflecting the ‘do nothing’ into the future (business-as-usual), and the alternative scenarios, reflecting the consequences incurred by the implementation of the policy options under study. Such prospective and broadened boundary nature of policy IA challenges traditional LCA/LCC practices mostly based on retrospective, static scenarios and datasets. The present study provides an overview of recent IA studies supporting waste policy to show the state-of-the-art and the main challenges associated with the application of life cycle methods in IA, focusing on the most recent EU waste and circular economy policies. Moreover, since specific and transparent guidance on how to implement consistently these methods in policy IA is lacking, the study provides an initial guidance for application of life cycle thinking in IA drawing upon the knowledge obtained conducting waste policy IA studies. Key challenges in the field are still to be addressed, and might inspire further research to improve the application of life cycle thinking to policy assessment.",,"Circular economy, Recycling, Future scenario, Sustainability, prospective LCA"

Public awareness of this cultural heritage often involves related product development efforts. However, the current development of Xinjiang brocades faces challenges, including insufficient refinement of design elements and a lack of sustainable innovation methods. To address these issues, this study proposed a Xinjiang Brocade Innovative Design Model by applying design thinking (DT). The DT process for the Xinjiang Brocade Innovative Design Model was first constructed in terms of applying Action Design Research (ADR). In addition, primary issues of Xinjiang Brocade Innovative Design were identified by applying Empathize Map and Delphi Method. The prototype for Xinjiang Brocade Innovative Design was then obtained through brainstorming, Adobe Experience Design, and so on. Moreover, the application of this Xinjiang Brocade Innovative Design Model was conducted with developing a Xinjiang brocade innovative design system, and it was validated. The results show the effectiveness of the Xinjiang Brocade Innovative Design Model, which not only organizes the knowledge and product information of existing Xinjiang brocades but also facilitates innovative customization, thereby enhancing user satisfaction.",,"Innovative design model, Xinjiang brocades, Design Thinking (DT), Action Design Research (ADR)"

Positive thinking, characterized by optimism, constructive self-talk, and a proactive mindset, enhances resilience and supports healthy habits crucial for neuroplasticity and synaptic development. Research underscores its significant role in hormonal regulation, benefiting both physical and mental well-being. This cognitive approach amplifies positive emotions and is integral to cognitive-behavioral modification. Synaptic plasticity, essential for learning and memory, involves activity-dependent strengthening or weakening of synapses, categorized into short-term (e.g., working memory and decision-making) and long-term (e.g., learning and retention). These processes are regulated by long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), influenced by factors such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), astrocytes, medications, and non-invasive interventions. Positive thinking boosts serotonin production, activates dopamine neurons, and lowers cortisol levels, facilitating adaptive learning through interactions between the limbic system and prefrontal cortex. Dopamine promotes neurogenesis by maintaining neural precursor cells, while reduced cortisol levels improve hippocampal synaptic plasticity, enhancing adaptability, learning, and memory retention. Ultimately, positive thinking plays a critical role in advancing education, improving mental health treatment, and serving as the foundation for cognitive training.",Elsevier,"Positive thinking, Synapse, Synaptic plasticity, Interconnection of positive thinking and synaptic plasticity"

Objective The current study investigated if single session and repeated anodal tDCS over the right DLPFC induces effects on judgment and decision-making performance and whether these are linked to working memory (updating) performance or cognitive inhibition. Methods Participants received anodal tDCS over the right DLPFC once (plus sham tDCS in a second session) or twice (24 h apart). In the third group participants received a single session of sham stimulation only. Cognitive characteristic measures were administered pre-stimulation (thinking disposition, impulsivity, cognitive ability). Experimental tasks included two versions of the Cognitive Reflection Test (numeric vs verbal-CRT), a set of incongruent base-rate vignettes, and two working memory tests (Sternberg task and n-back task). Forty-eight participants (mean age = 26.08 ± 0.54 years; 27 females) were recruited. Results Single sessions of tDCS were associated with an increase in reflective thinking performance compared to the sham conditions, with stimulation improving scores on incongruent base rate tasks as well as marginally improving numeric CRT scores (compared to sham), but not thinking tasks without a numeric component (verbal-CRT). Repeated anodal stimulation only improved numeric CRT scores. tDCS did not increase working memory (updating) performance. These findings could not be explained by a practice effect or a priori differences in cognitive characteristics or impulsivity across the experimental groups. Conclusion The current results demonstrate the involvement of the right DLPFC in reflective thinking performance which cannot be explained by working memory (updating) performance or general cognitive characteristics of participants.",,"Thinking, Judgment & decision-making, Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, Transcranial direct current stimulation, Executive functions"

For that purpose, we use the seminar transcripts of the Design Thinking Research Symposium 12 (DTRS12) dataset “Tech-centred Design Thinking: Perspectives from a Rising Asia,” which are primarily concerned with how Korean companies implement design thinking and what role designers currently play. We employed a novel method of information processing based on constructed dynamic semantic networks to investigate the seminar discussions according to company representatives and company size. We compared the quantitative dynamics in two seminars: the first involved managerial representatives of four companies, and the second involved specialized designers and management of a design center of single company. On the basis of dynamic semantic networks, we quantified the changes in four semantic measures—abstraction, polysemy, information content, and pairwise word similarity—in chronologically reconstructed individual design-thinking processes. Statistical analyses show that design thinking in the seminar with four companies, exhibits significant differences in the dynamics of abstraction, polysemy, and information content, compared to the seminar with the design center of single company. Both the decrease in polysemy and abstraction and the increase in information content in the individual design-thinking processes in the seminar with four companies indicate that design managers are focused on more concrete design issues, with more information and less ambiguous content to the final design product. By contrast, specialized designers manifest more abstract thinking and appear to exhibit a slightly higher level of divergence in their design processes. The results suggest that design thinking and creativity issues are articulated differently depending on designer roles and the company size.",,"Creativity, Design process, Design thinking, Information content, Semantic measures, Semantic networks"

Our analyses suggest that automatic assessment of message similarity aligns with human judgements. Furthermore, message similarity is positively associated with signs of suicidal ideation/non-suicidal self-injury, and this association is stronger in users who post predominantly negative content, in line with observations from the literature. This effect has a relatively small magnitude and may be less visible in machine learning models with a large number of predictors.

In the analysis, we consider the incompressible isothermal turbulent airflow to examine the interaction of the flow with the building for a better understanding of the wind-driven self-sustaining ventilation mechanism. We also propose a modified model via enlarging the aeration opening with the least blockages along the wind pathway.

Chief among these is the process of thought itself: the spontaneous emergence of specific ideas within the stream of consciousness. It is widely accepted that ideas, both familiar and novel, arise from the combination of existing concepts. From this perspective, thought is an emergent attribute of memory, arising from the intrinsic dynamics of the neural substrate in which information is embedded. An important issue in any understanding of this process is the relationship between the emergence of conceptual combinations and the dynamics of the underlying neural networks. Virtually all theories of ideation hypothesize that ideas arise during the thought process through association, each one triggering the next through some type of linkage, e.g., structural analogy, semantic similarity, polysemy, etc. In particular, it has been suggested that the creativity of ideation in individuals reflects the qualitative structure of conceptual associations in their minds. Interestingly, psycholinguistic studies have shown that semantic networks across many languages have a particular type of structure with small-world, scale free connectivity. So far, however, these related insights have not been brought together, in part because there has been no explicitly neural model for the dynamics of spontaneous thought. Recently, we have developed such a model. Though simplistic and abstract, this model attempts to capture the most basic aspects of the process hypothesized by theoretical models within a neurodynamical framework. It represents semantic memory as a recurrent semantic neural network with itinerant dynamics. Conceptual combinations arise through this dynamics as co-active groups of neural units, and either dissolve quickly or persist for a time as emergent metastable attractors and are recognized consciously as ideas. The work presented in this paper describes this model in detail, and uses it to systematically study the relationship between the structure of conceptual associations in the neural substrate and the ideas arising from this system’s dynamics. In particular, we consider how the small-world and scale-free characteristics influence the effectiveness of the thought process under several metrics, and show that networks with both attributes indeed provide significant advantages in generating unique conceptual combinations.",,"Semantic networks, Semantic cognition, Creativity, Cognitive dynamics, Itinerant dynamics, Attractor networks"

Moreover, no vaccine has been approved against it so far. Hence, the present study aimed to introduce novel immunogenic and drug targets against antibiotic-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae strains. In the first step, the core proteins of 79 complete genomes of N. gonorrhoeae were retrieved. Next, the surface-exposed proteins were evaluated from different aspects such as antigenicity, allergenicity, conservancy, and B-cell and T-cell epitopes to introduce promising immunogenic candidates. Then, the interactions with human Toll-like receptors (TLR-1, 2, and 4), and immunoreactivity to elicit humoral and cellular immune responses were simulated. On the other hand, to identify novel broad-spectrum drug targets, the cytoplasmic and essential proteins were detected. Then, the N. gonorrhoeae metabolome-specific proteins were compared to the drug targets of the DrugBank, and novel drug targets were retrieved. Finally, the protein data bank (PDB) file availability and prevalence among the ESKAPE group and common sexually transmitted infection (STI) agents were assessed. Our analyses resulted in the recognition of ten novel and putative immunogenic targets including murein transglycosylase A, PBP1A, Opa, NlpD, Azurin, MtrE, RmpM, LptD, NspA, and TamA. Moreover, four potential and broad-spectrum drug targets were identified including UMP kinase, GlyQ, HU family DNA-binding protein, and IF-1. Some of the shortlisted immunogenic and drug targets have confirmed roles in adhesion, immune evasion, and antibiotic resistance that can induce bactericidal antibodies. Other immunogenic and drug targets might be associated with the virulence of N. gonorrhoeae as well. Thus, further experimental studies and site-directed mutations are recommended to investigate the role of potential vaccine and drug targets in the pathogenesis of N. gonorrhoeae. It seems that the efforts for proposing novel vaccines and drug targets appear to be paving the way for a prevention-treatment strategy against this bacterium. Additionally, a combination of bactericidal monoclonal antibodies and antibiotics is a promising approach to curing N. gonorrhoeae.",,"Gonorrhea, Reverse vaccinology, Comparative genomics, Essential proteins, Immunogenic targets"

We find that, like adults tested in a previous study, 4- to 8-year-olds build by creating a small subset of possible individual states and full build paths, and that they prioritize building layer-by-layer. The individual states and build paths that children produce are strikingly similar to those of adults, resulting in structures that are more stable than other possible (but not attested) states and paths.

We examine the current state of the art and areas in need of continued development. For example, medical image-based model-building software has been developed based on numerous different methods. However, none of them can be used to construct a model with a simple “click of a button.” The creation of a faithful, representative anatomic model, especially in pediatric subjects, often requires skilled manual intervention. In addition, information from a second imaging modality is often required to facilitate this process. We describe the technical aspects of model building, provide a definition of some of the most commonly used terms and techniques (e.g. meshes, mesh convergence, Navier-Stokes equations, and boundary conditions), and the assumptions used in running the simulations. Particular attention is paid to the assignment of boundary conditions as this point is of critical importance in the current areas of research within the realm of congenital heart disease. Finally, examples are provided demonstrating how computer simulations can provide an opportunity to “acquire” data currently unobtainable by other modalities, with essentially no risk to patients. To illustrate these points, novel simulation examples of virtual Fontan conversion (from preoperative data to predicted postoperative state) and outcomes of different surgical designs are presented. The need for validation of the currently employed techniques and predicted results are required and the methods remain in their infancy. While the daily application of these technologies to patient-specific clinical scenarios likely remains years away, the ever increasing interest in this area among both clinicians and engineers makes its eventual use far more likely than ever before and, some could argue, only a matter of [computing] time.",,"Hemodynamics, Computer modeling, Boundary conditions, Clinical data, Congenital heart disease"

We considered a key higher order role: tracking progress throughout an action. We propose that doing so requires population activity to display low ""trajectory divergence"": situations with different future motor outputs should be distinct, even when present motor output is identical. We examined neural activity in SMA and primary motor cortex (M1) as monkeys cycled various distances through a virtual environment. SMA exhibited multiple response features that were absent in M1. At the single-neuron level, these included ramping firing rates and cycle-specific responses. At the population level, they included a helical population-trajectory geometry with shifts in the occupied subspace as movement unfolded. These diverse features all served to reduce trajectory divergence, which was much lower in SMA versus M1. Analogous population-trajectory geometry, also with low divergence, naturally arose in networks trained to internally guide multi-cycle movement.",,"supplementary motor area, motor control, motor cortex, population coding, recurrent neural network, neural dynamics, neural computation, population geometry"

It is part of the main axis of the basal ganglia (BG) that connects the thalamo-cortical networks to the BG input stages (striatum and subthalamic nucleus) and continues directly, and indirectly through the GPe, to the BG output stages (GPi and substantia nigra reticulata). Here we review the unique anatomical and physiological features of the pallidal complex and argue that they support the main computational goal of the BG main axis (actor); namely, a behavioral policy that maximizes future cumulative gains and minimizes costs. The three mono-layer competitive networks of the BG main axis flexibly extract relevant features from the current state of the thalamo-cortical activity to control current (ongoing) and future actions. We hypothesize that the striatal and the subthalamic projections neurons act as mono-stable integrators (class I excitability) and the in-vivo pallidal neurons act as bi-stable resonators (class II excitability). GPe neurons exhibit pausing behavior because their membrane potential lingers in the vicinity of an unstable equilibrium point and bi-stability, and these pauses enable a less-greedy exploratory behavioral policy. Finally, degeneration of midbrain dopaminergic neurons and striatal dopamine depletion (as in Parkinson's disease) lead to augmentation of striatal excitability and competitive dynamics. As a consequence the pallidal network, whose elements tend to synchronize as a result of their bi-stable resonance behavior, shifts from a Poissonian-like non-correlated to synchronous oscillatory discharge mode.

The present work is proposed with a motto to develop a stochastic framework for the e-waste management plant to optimize its availability integrated with reliability, availability, maintainability, and dependability (RAMD) measures and Markovian analysis to estimate the steady-state availability of the E-waste management plant. In the analysis an effort is also made to identify the best performing algorithm for availability optimization of the e-waste plant. Methodology A stochastic model for a particular plant is developed and its availability is optimized using various metaheuristic approaches like a genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and differential evolutions (DE). The most sensitive component is identified using RAMD methodology while the effect of deviation in various failure and repair rates are observed by the proposed model. The failure and repair rates follow an exponential distribution. All time-dependent random variables are statistically independent. Originality/Novelties A novel stochastic model is presented for an e-waste management plant and optimum availability is obtained using metaheuristic approaches. The proposed methodology is not so far discussed in the reliability analysis of process industries. Findings The numerical results of the proposed model compared to identify the most efficient algorithm. It is observed that genetic algorithm provides the maximum value (0.92330969) of availability at a population size 2500 after 500 iterations. PSO algorithm attained the maximum value (0.99996744) of availability just after 50 iterations and 100 population size. So, its rate of convergence is faster than GA. The optimum value of availability is 0.99997 using differential evolution after 500 iterations and population size of more than 1000. These findings are very beneficial for system designers. Practical Implications The proposed methodology can be utilized to find the reliability measures of other process industries.",,"E-waste management plant, Availability, Maintainability, Genetic Algorithm, Differential Evolution, Particle Swarm Optimization, Markov Birth-Death Process"

However, the nature of this relationship is not well understood. One prominent account posits that phonological short-term memory (PSTM) is a causal determinant both of nonword repetition ability and of phonological vocabulary learning, with the observed correlation between the two reflecting the effect of this underlying third variable (e.g., Baddeley, Gathercole, & Papagno, 1998). An alternative account proposes the opposite causality: that it is phonological vocabulary size that causally determines nonword repetition ability (e.g., Snowling, Chiat, & Hulme, 1991). We present a theory of phonological vocabulary learning, instantiated as a computational model. The model offers a precise account of the construct of PSTM, of performance in the nonword repetition task, of novel word form learning, and of the relationship between all of these. We show through simulation not only that PSTM causally affects both nonword repetition accuracy and phonological vocabulary size, but also that phonological vocabulary size causally affects nonword repetition ability. The plausibility of the model is supported by the fact that its nonword repetition accuracy displays effects of phonotactic probability and of nonword length, which have been taken as evidence for causal effects on nonword repetition accuracy of phonological vocabulary knowledge and PSTM, respectively. Thus the model makes explicit how the causal links posited by the two theoretical perspectives are both valid, in the process reconciling the two perspectives, and indicating that an opposition between them is unnecessary.",,"Nonword repetition, Vocabulary learning, Computational modeling, Phonological memory, Word learning, Short-term memory, Language"

Although one system (OROC) did simulate some aspects of human strategies for the AUT, most recent attempts have not been simulation-oriented, but rather have used Large Language Model (LLM) systems such as GPT-3 which embody extremely large connectionist networks trained on huge volumes of textual data. Studies reviewed here indicate that LLM based systems are performing on the AUT at near or somewhat above human levels in terms of scores on originality and usefulness. Moreover, similar patterns are found in the data of humans and LLM models in the AUT, such as output order effects and a negative association between originality and value or utility. However, it is concluded that GPT-3 and similar systems, despite generating novel and useful responses, do not display creativity as they lack agency and are purely algorithmic.

Later we review the basic neural mechanisms associated with creating meaning in both approaches: lateral inhibition and the creation of cortical maps by resonance to patterns of stimuli of families of spatially ordered neurons. We end by considering the usefulness in artificial intelligence of knowledge about the way in which biological systems construct their representation spaces. We stress the idea regarding events as representation entities and, consequently, using an event time, different from physical time. Semantics emerges from the mechanisms that detect these relevant events in each organisational level and their composition rules to specify the constitutive entities of the next level.

An interaction of odors and hormones is required for mating in this species. These two essential stimuli are transmitted through separate parallel pathways in the limbic system. The functional organization of the hamster mating behavior circuit is characterized by distributed representation, divergent and convergent neural pathways, and recurrent feedback. Odors and hormones have different modes of action on this neural network. While chemosensory cues stimulate the input units of the network, steroids facilitate behavior through the hidden units.

Interest in this area has increased significantly in recent years, and an increasing number of firms employ this approach, especially in the early stages of the innovation process, in which context design thinking is used to gain insights into user needs and generate new ideas. However, empirical evidence regarding the timing and process associated with the deployment of design thinking during the three different phases of the innovation process (fuzzy front end, development and testing, and commercialization) remains very limited. This gap may hinder research and practical advancements regarding when and how to implement design thinking in the innovation process. We explore this problem through a case study of a leading Chinese technology firm in the refrigeration industry using a longitudinal lens. We show that when and how the firm uses the four design thinking practices—(1) user-centeredness, (2) embracing diversity, (3) visualization and (4) iteration—to enable a transition from the fuzzy front end to development and testing and ultimately to commercialize a new product. Moreover, our findings suggest that the firm needs to adapt to the changing innovation goals and dynamically adjusts the content and intensity of design thinking practices as the innovation phase progresses. These findings therefore offer practical guidance for managers adopting design thinking to promote innovation.",,"Design thinking, Design thinking implementation, Design thinking practice, Innovation, Innovation process, Commercialization"

However, such programs are still lacking for undergraduate medical students, and new approaches are required to prepare them for the arrival of new and unknown technologies. At University Paris Cité medical school, we designed an innovative program to develop the digital health critical thinking of undergraduate medical students that consisted of putting medical students in AI-CDSS designers’ shoes. Methods We followed the six steps of Kern’s approach for curriculum development: identification of needs, definition of objectives, design of an educational strategy, implementation, development of an assessment and design of program evaluation. Results A stand-alone and elective AI-CDSS program was implemented for fourth-year medical students. Each session was designed from an AI-CDSS designer viewpoint, with theoretical and practical teaching and brainstorming time on a project that consisted of designing an AI-CDSS in small groups. From 2021 to 2022, 15 students were enrolled: they rated the program 4.4/5, and 80% recommended it. Seventy-four percent considered that they had acquired new skills useful for clinical practice, and 66% felt more confident with technologies. The AI-CDSS program aroused great enthusiasm and strong engagement of students: 8 designed an AI-CDSS and wrote two scientific 5-page articles presented at the Medical Informatics Europe conference; 4 students were involved in a CDSS research project; 2 students asked for a hospital internship in digital health; and 1 decided to pursue PhD training. Discussion Putting students in AI-CDSS designers’ shoes seemed to be a fruitful and innovative strategy to develop digital health skills and critical thinking toward AI technologies. We expect that such programs could help future doctors work in rapidly evolving digitalized environments and position themselves as key leaders in digital health.",,"Digital health, Artificial Intelligence, Clinical Decision Support System, Teaching, Education, Medical Student"

Adolescents with higher levels of math anxiety need more time to analyse and repress or miss the solutions when they are presented with even the simplest arithmetic problems. fMRI is being used for investigating cognitive processes such as learning, memory, and creativity and emotional states such as anxiety. However, there is a lack of research focusing on fMRI studies on the relationships between anxiety and brain functions in adolescence. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the relationship between anxiety and mathematical thinking capabilities of the 12th-grade students in Turkey. Initially, 68 12th-grade students were surveyed by state-trait anxiety inventory and perceived stress scale. Participants who were in the highest 20 % (n1 = 9) and the lowest 20 % (n2 = 14) groups (n = 23) were selected for the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study. The modifications of participants’ cerebral activation patterns were monitored via a 3 T MRI scanner while solving six mathematics questions. Subsequently, the data were analysed to reveal how anxiety levels correlate with brain activations and academic achievement. Activity in the frontal cortex of all participants increased during the use of mathematical skills. However, a significantly higher level of increment –intensively in the right frontal cortex- was detected on the participants with high anxiety. No statistically significant difference was observed between academic achievements and anxiety levels of the subjects.",,"Mathematical thinking, Anxiety, fMRI, Adolescence, Education"

During the course of DT, as ideation proceeds, ideas tend to become more creative, being more likely to be drawn from new conceptual categories through the use of the cognitive mechanism of flexibility. The present study investigated whether EEG alpha synchronization can be modulated by flexibility in DT by comparing cortical activation patterns during the switch of category (switching) and the stay in the same category (clustering). Twenty participants were required to generate alternative uses of everyday objects during EEG recording. Differential results were specifically found in the lower alpha band (8–10 Hz): whereas clustering showed synchronization typically lateralized in the right posterior parietal areas, switching induced posterior parietal synchronization over both right and left hemispheres. These findings indicate that the two distinct cognitive mechanisms subsuming flexibility (switching and clustering) are associated with a different hemispheric modulation of lower alpha activity, as switching, in comparison to clustering, is related to higher power in the lower alpha band over the left hemisphere. Switching in comparison to clustering may thus require a larger investment of cognitive resources due to the exploratory process of moving from one semantic conceptual category to another in the course of creative ideation.",,"Creativity, Divergent thinking, Flexibility, EEG oscillations, Alpha frequency band"

We term this “thinking locally” Fundamental to thinking locally is that a global approach to spatial analysis may not be suitable and that there may be situations where the conditioned relationships we want to measure vary over space. This paper examines the implications of thinking locally not only for modeling spatial processes but also more broadly in terms of our understanding of behavior in space. We begin with a brief survey of local statistical modeling and what might cause relationships to vary spatially and then describe the operation of one type of local modeling framework – that of (Multiscale) Geographically Weighted Regression – to demonstrate the basic concepts inherent in local models and the type of output that is generated by such models. We then examine the implications of a local approach to statistical analysis focussing on the role of local models compared to spatial regression models, diagnostics for local models, and how a local approach relates to issues of spatial scale which have plagued spatial analysis for decades. Attention is then turned to the implications of a local modeling approach to society, commenting on replicability and how local models can be used to measure previously unmeasurable place-based ‘contextual’ effects. We demonstrate the issues raised throughout the paper with an empirical example of house price determinants.",,"Local modeling, Multiscale geographically weighted regression, Spatial process scale, Spatial context, MAUP, Replicability"

Despite electric buses showing great potential to reduce emissions during their operational phase, the transformation from diesel buses to electric buses would require in-depth analysis pertaining to their economic and social implications. Published literature highlights the importance of developing a comprehensive framework that considers multiple decision parameters over a life cycle perspective for analyzing different fuel options to replace the existing fleet of diesel buses. This paper assesses the triple-bottom-line sustainability of diesel and electric buses in different regions of Canada. Moreover, a framework is proposed to incorporate multiple decision criteria (life cycle environmental, economic, and social impacts) over different perspectives to make the best decisions for transitioning the diesel bus fleet. The results showed that the environmental performance of electric buses highly depended on the electricity grid mix. Despite diesel buses having a low cost of production compared to electric buses, most provinces showed a low life cycle operational cost for electric buses. Electric buses’ life cycle social impacts are high during their production stage, whereas diesel buses have the highest social impacts during their operational phase. Overall, electric buses have a high sustainability performance in all provinces and territories in Canada except Nunavut. The proposed framework and findings can aid policymakers and planners in implementing electric buses for public transit systems in Canada and beyond.",,"Bus transit, diesel bus, life cycle sustainability assessment, life cycle thinking, transport electrification"

First, we investigated the dimensionality of several prominent cognitive bias tasks to see whether a single rationality factor can explain a performance on these tasks. Second, we validated this factor by correlating it with a number of constructs from its nomological network (fluid intelligence, numeracy, actively open-minded thinking, conspiracy and superstitious thinking, personality traits) and several real-life outcomes (decision-outcome inventory, job and career satisfaction, peer-rated decision-making quality). Although in both studies one-factor solution was the most appropriate for our tasks, this factor (i.e., “rationality factor”) was weak and only able to account for modest portion of variance among the tasks. Across both studies, the two strongest correlates of this rationality factor were numeracy and actively open-minded thinking. We conclude that cognitive bias tasks are highly heterogeneous, having very little in common. What they had in common, however, was largely underpinned by abilities and dispositions assessed with numeracy and actively open-minded thinking. We discuss how our findings relate to the dual-process theories and offer our view on the place of rationality in a broader model of human intelligence.",,"Rationality, Cognitive bias, Numeracy, Actively open-minded thinking, Intelligence"

Using online surveys, the primary data were collected from 315 e-customers of e-commerce businesses. Subsequently, the quantitative approach was used to analyse the data. The finding reveals that using a variety of techniques such as fuzzy logic, learning theory, evolutionary computation, genetic algorithms, and deep learning, CI predicts e-customer behaviour in a changing environment. Such a prediction results in desirable impacts, including more successful IM campaigns and retention actions.

While most studies on RNT have focused on structural and functional characteristics of gray matter, this study aimed to examine the association between white matter (WM) tracts and interindividual variability in RNT. Methods A probabilistic tractography approach was used to characterize differences in the size and anatomical trajectory of WM fibers traversing psychosurgery targets historically useful in the treatment of MDD (anterior capsulotomy, anterior cingulotomy, and subcaudate tractotomy) in patients with MDD and low (n = 53) or high (n = 52) RNT, and healthy control subjects (n = 54). MDD samples were propensity matched on depression and anxiety severity and demographics. Results WM tracts traversing left hemisphere targets and reaching the ventral anterior body of the corpus callosum (thus extending to contralateral regions) were larger in the high-RNT MDD group compared with low-RNT (effect size D = 0.27, p = .042) and healthy control (D = 0.23, p = .02) groups. MDD was associated with greater size of tracts that converge onto the right medial orbitofrontal cortex regardless of RNT intensity. Other RNT-nonspecific findings in MDD involved tracts reaching the left primary motor and right primary somatosensory cortices. Conclusions This study provides the first evidence to our knowledge that WM connectivity patterns, which could become targets of intervention, differ between high- and low-RNT participants with MDD.

This study proposes optimization solutions for integrated scheduling that bypass the need for specific processing and setup times, using systems thinking to prioritize operations based on their connections with the entire problem. A novel complex network modeling technique transforms the scheduling problem into a network, where operations act as nodes and operational constraints as edges. This transformation facilitates the determination of connections between operations based on network topology. Vital node identification metrics based on such connections are then explored to prioritize operations, leading to the design of complex network-based heuristic rules. Furthermore, the complex network modeling technique enables a network-based simulation framework, offering an efficient way to simulate and monitor real-world processes from a network perspective. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of these proposed rules, with insights derived from analyzing container handling equipment utilization, setup, and wait times.",,"Automated container terminal, Integrated scheduling, Complex network, Systems thinking, Time-independent solutions"

Data collected from 106 teams comprising 770 subordinates and 106 supervisors in China using the survey method reveal that team Zhongyong thinking is positively related to team incremental creativity but not team radical creativity via team decision comprehensiveness. Moreover, environmental dynamism moderates the influence of team Zhongyong thinking on team incremental creativity via team decision comprehensiveness. Specifically, when environmental dynamism is higher, this influence is stronger. These findings imply that via extensive information searching and inclusive decision-making, team Zhongyong thinking can benefit team incremental creativity, especially in a changing environment, but this thinking style has no significant influence on team radical creativity.",,"thinking, team decision comprehensiveness, environmental dynamism, team incremental creativity, team radical creativity"

OBJECTIVE Using a detailed case study of 50 farmers in two villages in Cabo Delgado (Northern Mozambique), this study seeks to test the hypothesis that farmers' perceptions of CA are associated with distinctly different ‘mental models’ and if these ""ways of thinking"" overlap with farmers' identified/self-identified groupings (e.g. CA users, ‘disadopters’ and conventional tillage users). Secondly, we examine whether these different mental models (perceptions) are associated with actual differences in on-farm measurements. Finally, we explore the hypothesis that ‘systems thinking’ (i.e., understanding nonlinear causal relationships and internal feedback loops that drive a complex system) and CA usage are positively associated. METHODS Fuzzy Cognitive Mapping (FCM) was used to elicit representations of farmers' mental models. To explore the association between farmers' mental models of CA/conventional practices and on-farm measurements we evaluated cowpea aboveground biomass, yield, weed cover, and soil quality parameters from the farmer's main plot. We drew on network analysis to measure structural metrics of cognitive maps that provide important information about a person's mental model (perceptions) of causal interdependencies of farming dynamics. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS We find evidence of two data-driven distinct clusters of farmers' mental models that are in relative alignment with farmers' identified/self-identified groupings. Cluster 1 mainly consists of conventional users and cluster 2 mainly consists of CA users/disadopters. While no significant differences in socio-demographic variables were observed, clusters of mental models were associated with key differences in on-farm measurements. Importantly, cluster 1, who tended to be conventional users, had lower yields, lower soil cover, significantly lower carbon stock and higher weed coverage than cluster 2. Soil quality indicators were higher in cluster 2 as were farmers' overall revenue per hectare. Moreover, cluster 2 had significantly higher degrees of ‘systems thinking’ (measured through complex network analysis of graphical mental models) than cluster 1 which had higher forms of linear thinking. We argue that higher forms of experiential learning and practice of CA relate to higher degrees of systems thinking and stronger positive perceptions of CA, even among the CA ‘disadopters’. SIGNIFICANCE Our findings highlight the importance of systems thinking abilities and inclusion of biophysical, socio-economic and mental modelling variables rather than simple binary measurements which may have led to erroneous conclusions on CA and thus has implications for how CA is understood and promoted in future.",,"Conservation Agriculture, Decision-making, Mental models, Cropping systems"

Given the transdiagnostic nature of RNT, this study aimed to evaluate the hypothesis that neurobiological substrates of RNT in MDD may share the brain mechanisms underlying obsessions, particularly those involving cortico-striatal-thalamic-cortical (CSTC) circuits. Methods Thirty-nine individuals with MDD underwent RNT induction during fMRI. Trait-RNT was measured by the Ruminative Response Scale (RRS) and state-RNT was measured by a visual analogue scale. We employed a connectome-wide association analysis examining the association between RNT intensity with striatal and thalamic connectivity. Results A greater RRS score was associated with hyperconnectivity of the right mediodorsal thalamus with prefrontal cortex, including lateral orbitofrontal cortex, along with Wernicke's area and posterior default mode network nodes (t = 4.66–6.70). A greater state-RNT score was associated with hyperconnectivity of the right laterodorsal thalamus with bilateral primary sensory and motor cortices, supplementary motor area, and Broca's area (t = 4.51–6.57). Unexpectedly, there were no significant findings related to the striatum. Conclusions The present results suggest RNT in MDD is subserved by abnormal connectivity between right thalamic nuclei and cortical regions involved in both visceral and higher order cognitive processing. Emerging deep-brain neuromodulation methods may be useful to establish causal relationships between dysfunction of right thalamic-cortical circuits and RNT in MDD.",,"Thalamus, Repetitive negative thinking, Rumination, Depression, Functional connectivity, Cortico-striatal-thalamic-cortical circuit"

The present research sought to dissociate neural contributions of these memory processes by inducing episodic or semantic retrieval orientations prior to performance on a divergent thinking task during fMRI. We conducted a representational similarity analysis (RSA) to identify multivoxel patterns of neural activity that were similar across induction (episodic and semantic) and idea generation. At the behavioral level, we found that semantic induction was associated with increased idea originality, assessed via computational estimates of semantic distance between concepts. RSA revealed that multivoxel patterns during semantic induction and subsequent idea generation were more similar (compared to episodic induction) within the left angular gyrus (AG), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), and left anterior inferior parietal lobe (IPL). Conversely, activity patterns during episodic induction and subsequent generation were more similar within left parahippocampal gyrus and right anterior IPL. Together, the findings point to dissociable contributions of episodic and semantic memory processes to creative cognition and suggest that distinct regions within the default network support specific memory-related processes during divergent thinking.",,"Creativity, Default network, Episodic memory, Semantic memory, Representational similarity analysis"

In this pre-registered study, we tested the effect of extraneous random stimuli using Wikipedia's random page generator on 592 British participants' performance across three online tasks: one ‘convergent’ forecasting task and two ‘divergent’ fluency tasks. We found no improvement associated with the treatment and often significant impairment. A Bayesian meta-analysis of the tasks finds strong support for the null hypothesis.

To address this issue, this study proposes an optimized field synergy strategy using a front-tracking algorithm, which analyzes the heat transfer in segmented regions rather than the entire domain. Four LHS units with varying shell shapes are designed and experimentally validated. The melting performance shows that the upward case improves the melting performance and heat transfer intensity by 17.44 % and 21.56 % compared to the benchmark case. Further analysis using the field synergy principle (FSP) explores the synergy and matching degree. The results indicate that heat transfer is driven by the combined effects of different regions, with heat transfer near the tube wall and the solid-liquid front dominating. The FSP analysis indicates that the heat transfer mechanism is affected by the comprehensive effect of the synergy and matching degree. Specifically, the matching degree is more crucial when the shell shape changes.

Educators, employers, and policymakers focus on CT skills to foster scientific thinking in education. In many countries, the development of CT skills has become a major component in education. CT skills training is offered to students based on the assumption that every student learns these skills in the same manner (i.e., homogeneity assumption). However, if heterogenous groups exist, accounting for this may provide more effective CT skills training. Methods Latent profile analysis (LPA) was applied to the Cornell Critical Thinking Test (CCTT) with middle school students from South Korea (N = 520), Turkey (N = 996), and the United States (N = 1,599), separately, to determine if CT subpopulations exist for each country. Generalizability of the latent profiles across countries were investigated through a multi-group LPA similarity assessment. Results Employing multiple fit criteria, a three-profile solution was identified for each country, and multi-group LPA analysis supported the similarity of the profiles across countries. Conclusion Similar CT skill profiles across countries suggest that interventions for developing CT skills may be appropriate across educational contexts.

The criteria indicators were defined to reflect the life cycle of environmental desirability and economic feasibility. The study introduces a framework-based approach using fuzzy multi-objective optimization by ratio analysis (FMOORA) with an integrated causality and importance weighting system. The core novelty of this study is the novel criterion weighting system that simultaneously considers the impacts of the internal and external causal relationships and the criteria importance arising from stakeholder priorities to derive a more realistic weighting scheme. Weighting schemes using fuzzy cognitive maps and the best-worst method were provided to consider the decision-maker’s priorities in highlighting each causality or importance weighting concept. Accordingly, the highest importance values of 0.152 and 0.267 were obtained for levelized cost of energy with fuzzy cognitive maps and the best-worst method, respectively. The profitability index scored the least importance values in both methods (fuzzy cognitive map – 0.071 and best-worst method – 0.038). Accordingly, RNG from livestock with pressure swing adsorption was ranked first under all weighting schemes. Hydrogen from steam methane reforming achieved the best spot under hydrogen production routes, with ranks varying from 8 to 12 when both RNG and hydrogen production scenarios are considered. The findings indicate that the proposed framework is useful for conducting preliminary feasibility assessments of gaseous fuel investment strategies.

However, exactly how children acquire the successor principle remains largely unexplained. Recently developed ideas within this family of theories posit that an abstract recursive successor function is acquired from the recursive structure of number words; however, the types of recursion underlying the successor function and number words are distinctively different (one is a self-referential function and the other is a self-embedded structure), making it difficult to theorize how one type triggers the acquisition of another. Moreover, our analysis of the literature questions if the knowledge about the successor principle is even empirically measurable. Here, we argue that number acquisition is a process of understanding a generative rule that governs the system of natural numbers and point out that the successor principle is not the only generative rule that governs the natural number system. We propose an alternative hypothesis that generative number concepts emerge from children's realization about how the combinatorial rules of numerals allow arithmetic (specifically additive and multiplicative) representations of quantity. Importantly, under addition and multiplication—which are historically rooted in concatenation and grouping of physical objects—natural numbers are mathematically closed. As a corollary, the system of infinitely generative natural numbers is conceptualized. This new theoretical framework allows the construction of novel empirical questions and testable hypotheses based on the formalized rules of numerical syntax and numeration systems, and therefore opens a new avenue for studying later stages of children's acquisition of number concepts.",,"Natural number acquisition, Number concepts, Numeration systems, Recursion, Successor function, Theories of mathematical cognition"

The increasing demand for resources is driven by a growing population and expanding economic development, inevitably leading to changes in consumption patterns within society. Therefore, sustainable resource management is crucial to minimizing the depletion of finite resources, reducing waste and emissions, and maintaining human well-being and socio-economic stability. Achieving this requires maintaining a balance between the supply and demand of natural resources, preventing overconsumption and overproduction, and promoting reuse, recycling, and recovery practices. A “new” system thinking approach is presented in this chapter aiming to realize a coherent systems approach that transcends discipline-specific approaches, avoiding limitations on insights and fostering innovation for discovering effective solutions. The new systems thinking framework for sustainable resource management comprises three key phases: problem and system definitions; system mapping and integration; and integrated sustainability assessment. This framework involves adopting an interdisciplinary approach, engaging stakeholders, conducting qualitative and quantitative assessments, and integrating sustainability thinking to address system problems effectively.",Elsevier,"Complex system, Decoupling, Interdisciplinary collaboration, Material footprint, Sustainability thinking, Sustainable resource management"

Besides leveraging advanced forecasting methods, post-processing has become a standard practice for solar forecasters to improve the initial forecasts. In this review, the post-processing task is divided into four categories: (1) deterministic-to-deterministic (D2D) post-processing, (2) probabilistic-to-deterministic (P2D) post-processing, (3) deterministic-to-probabilistic (D2P) post-processing, and (4) probabilistic-to-probabilistic (P2P) post-processing. Additionally, a total of ten overarching thinking tools, namely, (1) regression (D2D), (2) filtering (D2D), (3) resolution change (D2D), (4) summarizing predictive distribution (P2D), (5) combining deterministic forecasts (P2D), (6) analog ensemble (D2P), (7) method of dressing (D2P), (8) probabilistic regression (D2P), (9) calibrating ensemble forecasts (P2P), and (10) combining probabilistic forecasts (P2P), are proposed. These thinking tools can be thought of as the “style” or “mechanism” of post-processing. In that, the utilization of thinking tools circumvents the common pitfalls of classifying the literature by methods (e.g., statistics, machine-learning, or numerical weather prediction), which often leads to a “who used what method” type of roster review that is clearly ineffective, non-exhaustive, and dull. When myriads of post-processing methods are mapped to countable few thinking tools, it allows solar forecasters to enumerate the styles of adjustment that could be performed on a set of initial forecasts, which makes a post-processing task clearly goal-driven. Besides the thinking tools, this paper also emphasizes on the value of post-processing, and provides an outlook for future research. Although this paper is revolved around solar, the materials herein discussed can also be applied to wind and other forecasting areas.",,"Solar forecasting, Post-processing, Review, Probabilistic forecasting"

Importantly, we found a general group effect across all the sentence types, reflected in more positive P200 and less negative N400 responses in the AUT compared to the noAUT group, indicating that while the AUT group engaged more attentional resources during early lexical access, they required less extended cognitive mechanisms at the stage of lexico-semantic processing. The group effect was further observed in the LPC time window, where more positive amplitudes were found in the AUT relative to the noAUT group, suggesting a stronger semantic interconnectivity at the meaning integration stage when primed with a task eliciting divergent thinking processes.",,"Novel metaphors, Divergent thinking, Alternate uses task, ERPs"

It is unclear whether these perspective shifts are associated with changes in conscious thoughts and feelings about other people and the environment. In Study 1, we used a within-subject experiment to measure social and environmental thought content throughout 1-h environmental explorations of a nature conservatory and an indoor mall. At three survey time points, participants (N = 86, undergraduates and community members) reported whom they were thinking about and how connected they felt to the physical and social environment. Using Bayesian multi-level models, we found that while visiting the conservatory, participants were less likely to think about themselves, felt closer to people nearby and around the world, and felt higher connectedness to their social and physical environment. In Study 2, we used a correlational design to investigate the association between perceived naturalness of city parks and feelings of connection to nearby others and the physical environment while visiting.

The food-energy-water nexus is often proposed to be one such holistic approach.

Therefore, in this paper, the nexus is defined as a concept of systems thinking. A nexus systems thinking test is developed that can be used as a new way of categorizing nexus research. To examine the test's viability and suitability, it is applied to a sample data set of nexus-related research papers. By means of a multi- and mixed methods document analysis it is analyzed if the papers conceptualize the nexus approach as a systems thinking concept. The results show that all papers meet the four system criteria. Different emphasis, however, is put on certain aspects. The nexus systems thinking test proved to be a viable systematic method to investigate if and in which way nexus research incorporates a systems thinking perspective. It does not only offer a new way of categorizing nexus related research, but also allows assessing its quality from a comprehensive nexus perspective.

I draw on Kahneman's (2011) description of mental life by the metaphor of two agents, System 1 and System 2, which respectively produce fast and slow thinking. The capabilities of System 1 include –among other things– mental, linguistic and sociopragmatic activities, all of which have an effect on people's relational work (Locher and Watts 2005). Research in psychology (cf. McGuire and Botvinick 2010; Simon 1992; Klein 1999) suggests that the ‘intuitive’ System 1 is frequently more influential than the ‘rational’ System 2, the former thus being the secret author of many of human beings' choices and judgments, including those speakers make in discourse. My approach in this study is therefore multidisciplinary. Drawing from Cognitive Psychology, Cognitive Pragmatics, Functional Linguistics, (Socio)pragmatics and Discourse Analysis, I theoretically explore how the systems of fast and slow thinking participate in our discourse-pragmatic decisions and activities.

This quest for bridging explanations – or “consilience” – across the levels is a shared goal of computational psychiatry and cognitive neuropsychiatry and is, we argue, crucial to explaining delusional beliefs. We outline how early computational models appealed to prediction error disturbances as a basis for understanding the early emergence of delusions and show that, despite empirical support, there have been certain explanatory limitations that make a simple prediction error account partially limited. Embedding the account within the increasingly influential hierarchical predictive processing framework subsequently offered a more powerful and comprehensive account, particularly by encouraging the consideration hierarchically-organized inference and its evolution over time. However, further limitations remain in its explanatory scope, most notably the fact that delusions can emerge rapidly and suddenly in a way that seems revelatory and convincing. This phenomenon is not easily encompassed by the standard predictive processing account which emphasizes an iterative process of optimizing inference. However, more recent development in the form of “Hybrid Predictive Coding” posits a complementary rapid inference mechanism. We discuss how this hybrid approach may be key to a more comprehensive computational understanding of delusions. Résumé Nous présentons l’évolution d’un modèle computationnel des délires, en commençant par une réflexion sur la manière dont la psychiatrie computationnelle, dont les racines sont fermement ancrées dans la neuropsychiatrie cognitive, cherche à développer des modèles descriptifs et des mécanismes relevant de différents niveaux d’explication afin d’appréhender la manière dont les facteurs neurobiologiques, cognitifs, subjectifs et socioculturels peuvent tous contribuer à une psychopathologie complexe. Cette quête d’explications établissant des ponts entre niveaux – ou « consilience » – est un objectif commun de la psychiatrie computationnelle et de la neuropsychiatrie cognitive et est, selon nous, cruciale pour expliquer les croyances délirantes. Nous décrivons comment les premiers modèles computationnels ont invoqué des perturbations, des erreurs de prédiction pour comprendre l’émergence précoce des délires et nous montrons que, malgré un soutien empirique, la seule prise en compte des erreurs de prédiction est partiellement limitée. L’intégration de l’explication dans un modèle de traitement prédictif hiérarchique a ensuite apporté un pouvoir explicatif plus complet, notamment en encourageant la prise en compte de l’inférence organisée de manière hiérarchique et de son évolution au fil du temps. Cependant, d’autres limites subsistent dans sa portée explicative, notamment le fait que les délires peuvent émerger rapidement et soudainement d’une manière qui semble révélatrice et convaincante. Ce phénomène n’est pas facilement pris en compte par l’approche standard du traitement prédictif qui met l’accent sur un processus itératif d’optimisation de l’inférence. Cependant, un développement plus récent sous la forme du « codage prédictif hybride » propose un mécanisme d’inférence rapide complémentaire.

Despite the importance of these approaches, there has been a notable absence of efforts to compare them and consider how they might be integrated. This Personal View compares the three approaches and offers suggestions as to how they might work together, which represents a novel position. We view self-disturbances as transformations of self that form the inseparable background against which psychotic symptoms emerge. Integrating computational psychiatric approaches with those used by phenomenologists in the first two listed approaches, we argue that delusions and hallucinations are inferences produced under extraordinary conditions and are both statistically and experientially as real for patients as other mental events. Such inferences still approximate Bayes-optimality, given the personal, neurobiological, and environmental circumstances, and might be the only ones available to minimise prediction error. The added contribution we hope to make focuses on how the dialogue between neuroscience and phenomenology might improve clinical practice. We hope this Personal View will act as a timely primer and bridging point for the different approaches of computational psychiatry and phenomenological psychopathology for interested clinicians.",,

For instance, people are more inclined to judge that the last basket, rather than the first, caused the team to win the basketball game. This recency effect, however, reverses in cases of overdetermination: people judge that earlier events, rather than more recent ones, caused the outcome when the event is individually sufficient but not individually necessary for the outcome. In five experiments (N = 5507), we find evidence for the recency effect and the primacy effect for causal judgment. Traditionally, these effects have been a problem for counterfactual views of causal judgment. However, we argue that an extension of a recent counterfactual model of causal judgment explains both the recency and the primacy effect. In line with the predictions of our extended counterfactual model, we also find that, regardless of causal structure, people tend to imagine the counterfactual alternative to the more recent event rather than to the earlier one. Moreover, manipulating this tendency affects causal judgments in the ways predicted by this extended model: asking participants to imagine the counterfactual alternative to the earlier event weakens the interaction between recency and causal structure, and asking participants to imagine the counterfactual alternative to the more recent event strengthens the interaction between recency and causal structure. We discuss these results in relation to work on counterfactual thinking, causal modeling, and late-preemption.",,"Causal judgment, Recency, Counterfactual thinking, Imagination, Late preemption, Experimental philosophy"

CoDeT aims to scaffold children's collaboration and design thinking in co-design settings characterised by a high child-to-adult ratio (ca. 1 adult for 15 to 20 children), such as schools, museums and maker spaces. In these settings, children have to work relatively independent from adults who become guides on the side. This can be challenging due to children's limited understanding of the design process and their lack of skills to collaborate productively towards a shared design goal. CoDeT addresses these challenges by integrating principles of Social Interdependence Theory (SIT) and Design Thinking (DT), which together form the theoretical backbone of the approach.

In this course the students were exposed to basic systems concepts with a focus on system dynamics modeling (using Donella Meadows’ Thinking in Systems) of a permaculture-based food production system. They were given a basic problem: How much land area would be needed to collect enough solar energy in food plant photosynthesis per year to feed a community of fifty vegetarians? They were told that the farm would be in the Seattle WA, USA area so they could find the average monthly insolation values. Several additional rate constants and conversion factors were provided so they could build a spreadsheet-based model to generate the number of calories needed. This paper provides anecdotal evidence that systems theory naïve students were able to successfully build a model (in teams) but also were able to apply systems thinking to aspects of their own lives as demonstrated in essays (individuals). Many students reported “seeing the world differently” as a result of the course, particularly seeing how different aspects of the world are connected through various relations. As a result of these successes the course was upgraded to be a little more advanced for upper division students.2Problem-Project-based Learning - PPBL, a pedagogy for active learning.",,"Systems thinking, Naïve learners, System dynamics, Food production model, Problem and project-based learning"

Negative thinking styles are a core feature of major depression, fostering the experience of negative emotions and affects and hampering recovery. This cognitive vulnerability has been observed in medical conditions associated with depression, but never explored in post-COVID depression. Methods We studied 729 participants: 362 COVID-19 survivors, 73 inpatients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), and 294 healthy participants (HC). Severity of depression was self-rated on the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (ZSDS). Neuropsychological bias toward negative emotional stimuli and the negative outlook on the self were tested in a self-description task, yielding latencies and frequencies of attribution of morally tuned elements. Dimensions of negative thinking and depressive cognitive style in evaluation of hypothetical events were measured on the Cognition Questionnaire (CQ). Results 22.4% COVID survivors self-rated depression above the clinical threshold. Frequencies and latencies of attribution of morally negative elements, and CQ scores, correlated between themselves and predicted ZSDS scores, with post-COVID depressed patients showing intermediate scores between the more severe MDD patients, and non-depressed post-COVID participants and HC. Limitations Recruitment was in a single center, thus raising the possibility of population stratification. Conclusions The breadth of self-reproach and depressive cognitive style in evaluating events showed the same association with severity of depression in MDD and in post-COVID depressed patients, distributing along a gradient of severity, thus suggesting that individual features of negative thinking styles are shared in these conditions, and should be addressed as treatment targets in depressed COVID-19 survivors.",,"COVID, Depression, Cognition, Neuropsychology, Bias, Distortion"

Repetitive negative thinking (RNT) and difficulties regulating emotions are key transdiagnostic risk factors for depression and are key targets in current psychotherapies. The current study tested RNT and emotion regulation difficulties as mediators of the associations of depression with (1) physical activity and (2) sitting time. Method We analysed data from community-dwelling adults in middle to late adulthood (aged 46–68 at baseline; N = 1189) from The Busselton Healthy Ageing Study, assessed three times across 11 years. Serial mediation models were tested cross-sectionally, prospectively, and persistently (i.e., throughout the course of the study). Results Results indicated support for cross-sectional serial mediation for physical activity and sitting time models, but not for longitudinal models. However, RNT individually mediated the persistent sitting time-depression model. Limitations All data was self-reported. Mediators could only be assessed at the last time point within the larger study, constraining the temporal associations that could be tested. Further studies assessing mediators across time using different methods and time intervals are needed. Conclusions Our findings provide some initial evidence for psychological pathways by which the benefits of greater physical activity and lower sitting time may be conferred. If supported longitudinally and in experimental designs, increased physical activity and reduced sitting time may be beneficial therapeutic targets for older adults at risk for depression and/or who experience difficulties with rumination and emotion regulation.",,"Rumination, Emotion regulation, Sitting time, Older adults, Physical activity, Depression"

A brief history foreshadows aspects of a proposed taxonomy of attention that builds upon Posner's tripartite taxonomy. Posner's influential taxonomy views attention as a set of isolable neural systems (alerting, orienting and executive control), often working together to organize behaviour. For measuring the efficacy of these three networks, Posner and colleagues created the Attention Network Test (ANT). The impact of the taxonomy and this model task for exploring it is illustrated by the facts that they have spawned numerous variants designed for different purposes and that one or another variant has been used in almost a thousand publications. We have previously built upon this conceptual framework by considering: two modes of control over resource allocation which we labelled exogenous and endogenous and three domains over which these modes of control are presumed to operate (space, time and task or activity). The Combined Attention Systems Test (or CAST) was developed to measure the efficacy of the six kinds of attention implied by revised taxonomy. Lastly, this taxonomic effort is further developed by incorporating the distinction between overt, observable behaviour in the “real” world and covert “behaviour” in the realm of thought and imagination.",,"Attention, Thinking, Endogenous, Exogenous, Internal, External"

On the contrary, CT disposition (CTD) is more frequently mentioned in the workforce than CT skills. Furthermore, prevalent disposition instruments are mostly based on the literature and suggestions from educators, rather than employers' or employees’ perspectives. The purpose of this study is to design and validate the Employer-Employee-Supported Critical Thinking Disposition Inventory (2ES-CTDI) for college students to evaluate CTD. Intelligence accumulation (IA) was employed to synthesize the ideas from the literature, 25 employers, 43 employees, and a seven-person expert group. The interpretative structural model (ISM) was used to build the potential inventory. Validation data were collected from 661 Chinese undergraduate students (328 males, 49.6 %, Mean = 19.22, SD = 1.20 and 333 females, 50.4 %, Mean = 19.91, SD = 1.23) in 2021. Explorative factor analysis (EFA) was conducted for consistency between the conceptual framework and data. Confirmative factor analysis (CFA) and the common method variance (CMV) were adopted to check the model fit and structural validity. Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was used to identify the mediating effects among CTD components, and item response theory (IRT) was utilized to evaluate the test endorsement and item discrimination. Finally, a three-factor seven-point CT disposition inventory was confirmed. This newly-developed scale can be used to assess college students’ CTD as expected by the job market. While the inventory has been validated in this study, its contents are limited to intelligence obtained from the participants from some Chinese job markets.

We also aim to introduce the concept of systems thinking to enhance the performance of the prediction models. Methods Four popular algorithms were applied: (i) stepwise multiple linear regression; (ii) artificial neural networks; (iii) support vector machines; and (iv) gradient boosting machines. A linear regression model served as a baseline model for comparison. We conducted computational experiments based on a dataset collected from an emergency department in Hong Kong. Model diagnostics were performed, and the results were cross-validated. Results All the four machine learning algorithms with the use of systems knowledge outperformed the baseline model. The stepwise multiple linear regression reduced the mean-square error by almost 15%. The other three algorithms had similar performances, reducing the mean-square error by approximately 20%. Reductions of 17 – 22% in mean-square error due to the utilization of systems knowledge were observed. Discussion The multi-dimensional stochasticity arising from the ED environment imposes a great challenge on waiting time prediction. The introduction of the concept of systems thinking led to significant enhancements of the models, suggesting that interdisciplinary efforts could potentially improve prediction performance.

Environmental policy resistance has been identified as stemming from such complexities, yet we lack an understanding of how social and physical factors interrelate to inform policy design. The identification of synergies and trade-offs among various management strategies is necessary to generate optimal results from limited institutional resources. Participatory modeling has been used within the environmental community to aid decision-making by bringing together diverse stakeholders and defining their shared understanding of complex systems, which are commonly depicted by causal feedbacks. While such approaches have increased awareness of system complexity, causal diagrams often result in numerous feedback loops that are difficult to disentangle without further, data-intensive modeling. When investigating the complexities of human decision-making, we often lack robust empirical datasets to quantify human behavior and environmental feedbacks. Fuzzy logic may be used to convert qualitative relationships into semi-quantitative representations for numerical simulation. However, sole reliance upon computer-simulated outputs may obscure our understanding of the underlying system dynamics. Therefore, the aim of this study is to present and demonstrate a mixed-methods approach for better understanding: 1) how the system will respond to unique management strategies, in terms of policy synergies and conflicts, and 2) why the system behaves as such, according to causal feedbacks embedded within the system dynamics.

Inquiring about social issues is currently a common instructional strategy to enhancing generic critical thinking. It has been found effective in nurturing a mind that is structured and evidence-based (e.g., Angeli & Valanides, 2009; Ku, Ho, Hau, & Lau, 2014). Critical thinking, nonetheless, is “not mechanical” (Wegerif, 2007, p. 7). One current challenge is to integrate into the conventional logic-based practice of generic critical thinking instruction the ‘soft’ elements of thinking (Claxton, 1999). We argue that artwork presents itself as distinct and novel alternative to the more verbal-based learning materials that students are habituated. In observing and thinking about art images, pre-logical and preverbal thoughts and feelings that are otherwise not easily assessed can be elicited (Root-Bernstein & Root-Bernstein, 2003). Observing and imaging are primary thinking tools representing the more primitive, implicit, and sensual aspects of a person’s reasoning. In this article, we reviewed evidence of existing generic critical thinking instruction, and illustrated a strategy that infuses visual artwork as the problem context into Halpern’s (2003) Four-part Critical Thinking Instructional Model. There is a need for educators to acknowledge that any high quality thoughts must be a result of the mind simultaneously engaging in creation and critical evaluation of its creations (Paul & Elder, 2008). Though we are cautious not to make an automatic connection between reasoning about artwork and nurturing creative thinking, we considered our argument a step towards recognizing creative and critical thought as “integrated, and unitary” (Paul & Elder, 2006, p. 34).",,"Critical thinking, Instructional strategy, Art, Creative thinking"

These two processes are most often studied using the Alternate Uses Test (heavily relying on divergent thinking), and the Remote Associates Test (heavily relying on convergent thinking, at least with analytical solutions). Although creative acts should be regarded compound processes, most behavioral and neuroimaging studies ignore the composition of basic operations relevant for the task they investigate. In order to provide leverage for a more mechanistic, and eventually even comprehensive computational, approach to creative cognition, we compare findings from divergent and convergent thinking studies and review the similarities and differences between the two underlying types of processes, from a neurocognitive perspective with a strong focus on cortical structures. In this narrative review, we discuss a broad scope of neural correlates of divergent and convergent thinking. We provide a first step towards theoretical integration, by suggesting that creative cognition in divergent- and convergent-thinking heavy tasks is modulated by metacontrol states, where divergent thinking and insight solutions in convergent-thinking tasks seem to benefit from metacontrol biases towards flexibility, whereas convergent, analytical thinking seems to benefit from metacontrol biases towards persistence. These particular biases seem to be reflected by specific cortical brain-activation patterns, involving left frontal and right temporal/parietal networks. Our tentative framework could serve as a first proxy to guide neuroscientific creativity research into assessing more mechanistic details of human creative cognition.",,

If critical thinking is seen as a complex mix of knowledge, skills and dispositions that can be articulated and made an object of study in themselves, then there is scope for intentional and explicit targeting of such things. If, however, critical thinking is seen as a general skill more or less impermeable to pedagogical influence and best realised through the development of content knowledge, then an explicit focus on developing thinking skills is misplaced and potentially distracting. The latter view is that of cognitive load theory (CLT), a theoretical framing of thinking and learning that has gained traction in education including with practitioners. This paper will explore some of the assumptions of CLT and show that they are either (1) in error, (2) vaguely or confusingly expressed and/or (3) the conclusions drawn within the theory are often errors of inference. Moreover, I point out that important educational research that weakens the claims of CLT is often not engaged with or addressed.",,"Critical thinking, Cognitive load theory, Inquiry, Pedagogy, Dispositions"

Scholars refer to this shift in becoming creators of technology as computational making, which enables new forms of learning and thinking at the intersection of the physical and the digital. The interdisciplinary and multidimensional nature of computational making design processes means learners must negotiate their design idea across space, time, mode, and expertise. In this paper, we draw on multiple iterations of design and implementation work with wearable and locative technologies to investigate the affordances and challenges of design scaffolds in youths’ computational making design processes. We present examples from learning with electronic textiles and locative game design to illustrate the unique problem spaces of materiality and spatiality specific to computational making.

The findings of the study highlight the important relationship between the volume-specific surface area of objects and the dynamics of heat content change; that is, the rate at which the temperature of an object decreases is shown to additionally depend on the size of the volume-specific surface area of the object. If the surface area in contact with the environment is small compared to the volume of the object, then the effect of the environment (e.g., heat exchange, heat loss) on the object will also be small. Consequently, when attempting to enhance the energy efficiency in heat storage design, apart from increasing the thickness of the thermal insulating layer, the specific heat loss of an object could be lowered by reducing the volume-specific surface area as an additional option. This hypothesis was based on observations, and the observed phenomenon has been confirmed by a computational example following the renewed interpretation of Newton's law of cooling, which has become more understandable by applying critical thinking. Newton's law of cooling has been newly expressed for use in engineering design, practice, and education. The interpretation of this law presented in this study can be used to reduce specific heat loss and intensify heat transfer. The article draws attention to the importance of the volume-specific surface area, which is an important variable in many engineering fields other than the case presented here. The method described here can be viewed as an additional alternative to the traditional education methods considered in heat transfer textbooks.",,"Thermal energy, Heat storage, Energy efficiency, Thermal insulation, Critical thinking, Volume-specific area"

To evaluate the performance of this WtE treatment, the life cycle thinking (LCT) methodology gathers useful impact assessment tools, providing quantifiable indicators on multiple domains. The lack of works reporting the combined assessment of the environmental, technical, economic and social spheres of WtE has been previously noticed and, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, there is no such review so far for plasma gasification. This work proposes a deep review of literature on the life cycle assessment, life cycle costing and social impact assessment of plasma gasification, to evaluate how LCT tools are applied to the energetic valorization of solid residues by this technique, as a measure of sustainability. This provides insights on the contribution of energy recovery as a circular strategy, diverting waste from open dumps or landfills, while producing renewable energy and/or by-products that will replace the use of virgin materials. Herein, an attempt to complement the knowledge in the sectors of renewable energies and waste management is conducted, to support the fulfillment of circular economy goals and contribute to a more sustainable society and way of living.",,"Plasma, Gasification, LCA, LCC, Social assessment, Circular economy"

Previous studies show that profound understanding of human drivers’ capability to interpret and anticipate traffic situations is required in order to provide similar capacities for automated driving technologies. There is currently not enough a priori understanding of these anticipatory capacities for safe driving applicable to any given driving situation. To enable the development of safer, more economical, and more comfortable automated driving experience, expert drivers’ anticipations and related uncertainties were studied on public roads. First, driving instructors’ expertise in anticipating traffic situations was validated with a hazard prediction test. Then, selected driving instructors drove in real traffic while thinking aloud anticipations of unfolding events. The results indicate sources of uncertainty and related adaptive and social behaviors in specific traffic situations and environments. In addition, the applicability of these anticipatory capabilities to current automated driving technology is discussed. The presented method and results can be utilized to enhance automated driving technologies by indicating their potential limitations and may enable improved situation awareness for automated vehicles. Furthermore, the produced data can be utilized for recognizing such upcoming situations, in which the human should take over the vehicle, to enable timely take-over requests.",,"Automated driving, expert driver, prospective thinking-aloud, traffic safety, uncertainty, anticipation"

In particular, the relationship between spatial abilities and TetrisTM has been analysed several times in the literature. However, these analyses have shown contrasting results between the effectiveness of Tetris-based training activities to improve mental rotation skills. In this work, we studied whether, and under what conditions, such ability is used in the TetrisTM game by explicitly modelling mental rotation via an ACT-R based cognitive model controlling a virtual agent. The obtained results show meaningful insights into the activation of mental rotation during game dynamics. The study suggests the necessity to adapt game dynamics in order to force the activation of this process and, therefore, can be of inspiration to design learning activities based on TetrisTM or re-design the game itself to improve its educational effectiveness.",,"Cognitive architectures, ACT-R, Mental rotation, Tetris, Serious games design"

I briefly address contemporary debates over the nature of culture—embodied versus embedded—and argue for an ecological approach in which culture-in-action unfolds as embodied schemas recognize (and produce) “handles” in the environment. When schemas are “objectively adapted” to the handles, they generate action that is ecologically rational.

In this perspective, Education plays a fundamental role in ensuring that citizens acquire the required skills. The objective in the common European framework is clear: to initiate a transition from the culture of knowledge to the culture of competence.

This neglect is due, in part, to the limitations of the information processing paradigm that dominated cognitive psychology in its formative years. With the emergence of the embodiment approach to cognition, however, sport has become a dynamic natural laboratory in which to investigate the relationship between thinking and skilled action. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to explore some insights into the relationship between thinking and action that have emerged from recent research on exceptional performance states (e.g., ‘flow’ and ‘choking’) in athletes. The paper begins by explaining why cognitive psychologists’ traditional indifference to sport has been replaced by a more enthusiastic attitude in recent years. The next section provides some insights into the relationship between thinking and skilled action that have emerged from research on ‘flow’ (or peak performance) and ‘choking’ (or impaired performance) experiences in athletes. The third section of the paper explores some practical issues that arise when athletes seek to exert conscious control over their thoughts in competitive situations.

In this paper, we introduce a heuristic definition called pathogenesis network (PN) to represent pathogenesis in the form of the directed graph. Accordingly, a computational method of pathogenesis diagnosis, called network differentiation (ND), is proposed by integrating the holism principle in SS. ND consists of three stages. The first stage is to generate all possible diagnoses by Cartesian Product operated on specified prior knowledge corresponding to the input symptoms. The second stage is to screen the validated diagnoses by holism principle. The third stage is to pick out the clinical diagnosis by physician-computer interaction. Some theorems are stated and proved for the further optimization of ND in this paper. We conducted simulation experiments on 100 clinical cases.

Apart from its common risk factors such as aging, environment, and lifestyle elements, the risk of developing AD largely depends on gene variants, which present a promising opportunity for identifying novel diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers. Objectives Early studies have revealed numerous SNPs simultaneously associated with AD and other diseases such as Parkinson's disease, stroke, multiple sclerosis, and more. Therefore, it is important to conduct research on identifying single nucleotide missense mutations in certain genes specifically linked to AD to understand the prognosis and diagnosis of the disease. Methods In this research, we utilized multiple sequence-based computational tools and database servers to analyze specific missense single nucleotide polymorphisms and their potential effects on protein structure and stability. Results Our in-silico analysis revealed SNPs of 3 genes, specifically, ATP8B4, UBXN11, and TREM2, to be deleterious. The associating mutations were found to be destabilizing the protein structure and function of deleterious genes. Conclusion Three genes, including ATP8B4, UBXN11, and TREM2 and their associated SNPs, were found to be deleterious and are potentially linked to AD. Amino acid changes associated with these genes were found to affect their interactions, which are connected to specific biological processes and pathways that may trigger AD.",,"Alzheimer's disease, , SNP, Missense, Deleterious, Protein structure stability"

Here, we tested whether negative affective states are more likely to predict suicidal thoughts among those with BPD than those without this disorder. Data on affective states and suicidal thoughts were collected several times per day from 35 psychiatric inpatients using their smartphones to capture real-time associations between negative affect and suicidal thoughts. Results revealed that the association between negative affective states (e.g., abandonment, desperation, guilt, hopelessness, loneliness, rage, self-hatred, and upset), and severity of suicidal thinking was stronger among those with BPD than among those without BPD.

Several studies had shown that there are different results in EEG patterns of males and females. Therefore, this study examined the EEG pattern changes of males and females during convergent thinking (CT) and divergent thinking (DT) in comparison to the rest condition.Methods: This study was a fundamental-theoretical research with quasi experimental design. 34 subjects (19 boys and 15 girls) were chosen according to available sampling method by using a screening questionnaire. Each of them assigned in three conditions (rest, CT and DT). In the CT and DT conditions subjects were solved the tasks that were related to these two kinds of thinking but during rest condition they didn’t solve any task. In all three conditions, EEG patterns were recorded from 19 scalp areas. The recorded EEG in theta band, were transformed into quantitative form (QEEG) by using neuroguide software and these quantities analyzed by repeated measure ANOVA method.Results: descriptive results of this study had showed that coherence of EEG patterns in convergent thinking and divergent thinking are higher than rest condition. But there was no significant difference between these two kinds of thinking. Also the results of repeated measure ANOVA had shown that these 3 conditions hadn’t significant differences in coherence patterns in two genders. Conclusion: The results probably are due to neglect the especial function of each hemispheres. Other probability that we can consider for these results is the thinking skills that basically have no biological difference. these results can provide a background for future studies about cognitive functions.",,"QEEG, Coherence, Convergent thinking, Divergent thinking"

It assumes that all technologies are value-laden and that cultural activities, practices, designs, and knowledge can be computational. Within education, ethnocomputing has inspired the design of software and hardware to help children study the computing ideas that are embedded in Indigenous and vernacular epistemologies, designs, and practices, such as African American cornrow braiding, Anishinaabeg quilting, Ghanaian Adinkra stamping, and more. Not only does this provide a way to add epistemic diversity to computing curricula but it is also a challenge to Eurocentric histories of computer science. Quantitative research on these educational technologies has been promising in terms of supporting children's attitudes toward and content knowledge of computing. This research also suggests that just being exposed to these technologies may not be enough for students to make the connections between culture and computing that ethnocomputing assumes as its foundation. To address this challenge, we report findings from a multi-case study of four Black high school students who took on roles as ethnocomputing researchers during a five-week virtual after-school program. Instead of focusing on if the program supported their computer science content knowledge, we sought to study the students' meaning-making and knowledge production practices on culture and computing in their ethnocomputing research. Our findings show that while only two of the four children felt confident identifying themselves as ethnocomputing researchers by the time the program ended, all students were able to express nuanced and unique ideas about culture-computing relationships that were relevant to ethnocomputing.

Evidence from a meta-analysis and synthesis of qualitative data in educational contexts,"Sun, Lihui, Zhou, Liang",2023,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tsc.2023.101340,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1871187123001098,"Promoting computational thinking (CT) skills in programming activities has become a key issue in K-12 education, and the shift from visual to text-based programming is an inevitable trend in programming education. Although research on K-12 text-based programming to promote CT skills has been increasing, a literature review that systematically organizes and analyzes it has not yet emerged. Moreover, there are no uniform conclusions on how to design text-based programming activities to effectively promote students’ acquisition of CT skills. The purpose of this study was mainly to determine the effectiveness of using text-based programming to enhance K-12 students’ CT skills, to explore the effects of various text-based programming instructional design factors on CT skill acquisition, and to discuss the key issues and future development of text programming in the K-12 stage. In this study using the quantitative method of meta-analysis and the qualitative method of systematic literature review, 46 studies of text-based programming on K-12 students’ CT skills were retrieved, of which 19 empirical studies including 37 effects size met the inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis and were therefore used as a meta-analysis. The results showed that text-based programming improved the CT skills of K-12 students overall (Hedges’ g = 0.71, 95% CI [0.51, 0.90], p < 0.01). No publication bias was detected. In addition, the results of the moderator analysis revealed that: 1) text programming had the greatest impact on computational thinking development in middle school students (g = 0.833, p = <0.05); 2) the duration of text programming instruction had the most significant positive impact on students' CT at 16–20 weeks (g = 1.038, p <0.05); 3) the moderating effect of different assessment tools on CT skills in text programming instruction The difference was statistically significant, and the test assessment method had a highly significant positive moderating effect on CT skills of students in grades K-12 (g = 1.005, p < 0.05); 4) The moderating effect of different student sample sizes on students' computational thinking development was significantly different, and the implementation of text-based programming instruction had the most significant effect on students' CT improvement among students with sample sizes of 41 ∼ 60 (g = 0.921, p < 0.05); 5) There were no significant differences in the effects of different text-based programming languages and learning environments on students' computational thinking.However, there are still barriers to developing instructional practices for text-based programming to foster CT in K-12 students, such as the highly abstract and complex syntax of text-based programming. This study found that the most critical issues that need to be addressed in current text-based programming to foster CT in K-12 students are the lack of student interest in text-based programming and the misconceptions that arise when students move from visual programming to text-based programming. To address these issues, future research could begin with improving teaching methods and increasing student motivation and interest.

The study has been conducted with 300 students studying in the 7th and 8th grades in two private schools in Cankaya, Ankara. In the study “Reflective Thinking Skills towards Problem Solving Scale” (Kızılkaya & Askar, 2009) and “Mathematics Attitude Scale” (Onal, 2013) have been used. In order to determine the levels of students in terms of reflective thinking skills towards problem solving and their attitudes towards mathematics, the arithmetic mean and standard deviation values of the scores obtained via the scales have been calculated and to find out if there is a significant difference between these scores regarding gender, MANOVA has been used. Whether there is a significant difference between the scores of male and female students has been tested by using the scores the students got in total and in the sub-dimensions of the scales. It is found that there does not exist a significant difference between the students’ reflective thinking skills towards problem solving and their gender.

Therefore, researchers are paying increasing attention to computational scientific modeling in which students use the computational power of computers to model and learn about science phenomena. However, computational scientific modeling is challenging since it involves not only scientific concepts but also uses computational representations to model the science concepts. This study hypothesizes that prompting students to self-explain critical subgoals of computational scientific modeling before taking part in the construction of models would help them construct correct computational models. This study recruited 65 10th grade students in a 6-week program. They were randomly assigned to a self-explanation group (n = 29) where students learned with the self-explanation for subgoals of computational scientific modeling, and a demonstration group (n = 36) where the teacher directly demonstrated the modeling process before students took part in the modeling activity. This study collected the students' performance in a paper-based and hands-on modeling test, and also their modeling actions in the hands-on test to understand the impact of the self-explanation scaffolding on their computational scientific modeling. The results showed that the two groups demonstrated similar levels of improvements in the paper-based test, suggesting that both types of scaffolding are helpful for computational scientific modeling learning. However, the self-explanation group demonstrated significantly better modeling quality in the hands-on test. Furthermore, the spotlight analysis found the moderation effect of the modeling actions on the relation between the two treatments and the model quality. The self-explanation group constructed high quality models if they took only a low number of modeling actions. Conversely, frequent modeling actions are necessary for the demonstration group to construct quality scientific models. The results suggest that the self-explanation scaffolding is more effective since students did not simply rely on the trial-and-error strategy, but adopted a strategic approach to constructing scientific models.",,"Scientific modeling, Self-explanation, Subgoal learning, Demonstration, Learning analytics"

It comprises of two components: Imaginal Prefiguration and the Verbal Perseveration. DT has been found to be positively associated with alcohol use, gambling, nicotine use, and problematic Internet use. Despite this, neither qualitative nor quantitative reviews have been undertaken to critically summarize findings about the association between DT and addictive behaviours. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to evaluate the strength of the association between DT and addictive behaviours. Method In accordance to PRISMA criteria, a research was conducted on PubMed and PsycInfo. A manual search of reference lists was also run. Search terms were: “addiction / gambling / alcohol / tobacco / nicotine / drug / cocaine / marijuana / cannabis / opioid / heroin / methadone / internet” AND “Desire Thinking”. Results Ten studies were included. Both components of DT were found to be associated with addictive behaviours (alcohol use, nicotine use, gambling, problematic Internet use) in both clinical and community samples. The strength of the association between Verbal Perseveration and addictive behaviours appears to be stronger for alcohol and nicotine use than Internet use. The association between DT and addictive behaviours is not moderated by age. Conclusion DT is present across different addictive behaviours. The assessment of DT and tailored interventions aimed to reduce the propensity to engage in DT should be considered in the treatment of addictive behaviours.",,"Addiction, Smoking, Nicotine, Gambling, Internet, Desire Thinking"

The 12 Little Ducks problem stimulated children to visualize and to draw different ways of making equal groups. Fifteen children (83 %) could identify and create equal groups; eight of these children (44 %) could also quantify the number of groups they formed. These findings show that some young children understand early multiplicative ideas and can visualize equal group situations and communicate about these through their drawings and talk.

Recent experiments suggest a hypothesis that could explain this pattern: cognitive sophistication magnifies politically biased processing of new information. However, the designs of these experiments tend to contain several limitations that complicate their support for this hypothesis. In particular, they tend to (i) focus on people's worldviews and political identities, at the expense of their other, more specific prior beliefs, (ii) lack direct comparison with a politically unbiased benchmark, and (iii) focus on people's judgments of new information, rather than on their posterior beliefs following exposure to the information. We report two studies designed to address these limitations. In our design, U.S. subjects received noisy but informative signals about the truth or falsity of partisan political questions, and we measured their prior and posterior beliefs, and cognitive sophistication, operationalized as analytic thinking inferred via performance on the Cognitive Reflection Test. We compared subjects' posterior beliefs to an unbiased Bayesian benchmark. We found little evidence that analytic thinking magnified politically biased deviations from the benchmark. In contrast, we found consistent evidence that greater analytic thinking was associated with posterior beliefs closer to the benchmark. Together, these results are inconsistent with the hypothesis that cognitive sophistication magnifies politically biased processing. We discuss differences between our design and prior work that can inform future tests of this hypothesis.",,"Political beliefs, Bayesian updating, Cognitive sophistication, Polarization"

Thinking dispositions include tendencies or styles toward information processing, and the study of these tendencies in development has also been examined in the temperament and metacognitive literature. Cognitive abilities and thinking dispositions support the processing demands of judgment and decision-making tasks, including resistance to miserly information processing. Specific types of knowledge that support judgment and decision-making performance also emerge early in development, including probabilistic numeracy.

This paper presents an original semi-dynamic modelling framework that simultaneously considers i) ES supply and demand dynamics, ii) negative environmental impacts, externalities, and financial costs derived from NBS, and iii) life cycle NBS impacts beyond the use phase. Compared to other models, it also aims to be valuable for urban planning actions at site level, i.e., for evaluating the net impacts of specific urban NBS projects. To validate the modelling framework, a proof-of-concept model for urban forests is developed and tested for a case study in Madrid (Spain). The modelling framework is split in two interrelated parts: foreground (dynamic modelling) and background (static modelling). In the foreground, the environmental impacts derived from the use phase of an NBS project are quantified considering its spatio-temporal dynamism, by making use of system dynamics. In the background, the environmental impacts derived from the rest of the life cycle phases of the NBS are quantified making use of steady state life cycle impact assessment. The net economic impact of the NBS project, considering both financial values and externalities, is eventually calculated in the background encompassing all the life cycle phases. Results from the case study illustrate how planning, design, and management decisions over the entire life cycle of an urban forest can influence the net environmental and economic performance of this type of NBS. A discussion is provided to inform on how the modelling framework can help moving beyond the state-of-the-art, and how the derived model can be used for sustainability assessments of urban NBS projects.",,"Urban sustainability & Resilience, Ecosystem Services, System Dynamics, Life Cycle Assessment, Life Cycle Costing, Urban Ecology"

Accordingly, novel development approaches for community involvement and sustainability have to recognize the complex nature of social systems in which mining sector exists. The objective of this paper is to develop a community-centered approach by integrating rapid and participatory nature of design thinking with multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) in order to support sustainable development. While design thinking engages multiple stakeholders for generating alternatives, MCDA provides metrics for assessing these alternatives. Drawing on an example from a small scale mining development in Central America, this paper shows that early community involvement and rigorous impact assessment on a regular basis motivate community involvement and give value to the social outcome of mining development.",,"Design thinking, Decision analysis, Sustainability, Sustainable development, Small scale mining"

Digital fabrication (DF) and design thinking (DT) have been suggested as approaches to developing students’ understanding of technology and their agency in a digitised world. However, nowadays teachers are not being trained in this field. In order to prepare the next generation for a rapidly changing and unknown future heavily influenced by computing it thus seems necessary to focus on the professional development (PD) of teachers. This study investigates how development of professional practice can be conducted to empower teachers and principals to implement DF and DT activities in schools. Initially, the paper gives an overview of nine educational initiatives in the field, followed by a closer examination of the Danish FabLab@SCHOOLdk organisation. The paper identifies the different PD programmes aimed at empowering in-service teachers, pedagogues, and principals in the field of DF and DT. As the main contribution to the research community, the study identifies five important stakeholders that are supporting and operating in synergy inside the FabLab@SCHOOLdk initiative as well as the surrounding gatekeepers with influence on the development processes. The paper further illustrates how the stakeholders operate in the organisation to enable educators to apply DF and DT in schools and discusses the development of professional practice in this field.

This systematic review aimed to determine what is known regarding the factors influencing risk at RLXs, with a focus on understanding the causal relationships across the entire sociotechnical system. A systematic search identified 88 published studies. The studies were categorised according to the type of outcome measured or analysed: (1) rates and severity of crashes; (2) unsafe and non-compliant road user behaviours; and (3) road user risk perception, attitudes and beliefs. Most studies focused on unsafe and/or non-compliant road user behaviour. The factors identified within the studies as influencing risk at RLXs were classified using the Accident Mapping (AcciMap) technique, a systems analysis framework. AcciMap maps the factors that influence behaviour across six system levels ranging from Government to the operating environment. Most of the factors identified within the studies related to physical attributes of the crossing itself, its operation, and the behaviours and attributes of road users. Comparatively fewer systemic factors were identified (i.e. policy and budgeting). Few relationships between factors were identified, indicating that little consideration has been given interactions between factors (i.e. how crossing design influences end-user decision making). A research agenda is proposed based on systems thinking and the use of a ‘many model’ approach to understand and address risk at RLXs.",,"Rail level crossing, Railway crossing, Road user behaviour, Safety, Trains, AcciMap"

It is thus essential to understand why some individuals get stuck in recurrent negative thinking (RNT), whereas others are able to disengage eventually. Theoretical models propose that individuals high in recurrent negative thinking suffer from deficits in controlling the contents of working memory. Empirical findings, however, are inconclusive. In this meta-analysis, we synthesize findings from 94 studies to examine the proposed association between RNT and deficits in cognitive control. We included numerous effect sizes not reported in the primary publications. Moderator analyses tested the influence of variables, such as stimuli valence, cognitive control function (e.g., shifting, discarding), or type of RNT (i.e., rumination or worry). Results demonstrated an association between repetitive negative thinking and deficits in only one specific cognitive control function, namely difficulty discarding no longer relevant material from working memory (r = −0.20). This association remained significant after controlling for level of psychopathology. There was no substantial association between RNT and deficits in any other cognitive control function. All other moderators were not significant.

What consequences does this have for human cognition? We frame Smartphone use as an instantiation of the extended mind—the notion that our cognition goes beyond our brains—and in so doing, characterize a modern form of cognitive miserliness. Specifically, that people typically forego effortful analytic thinking in lieu of fast and easy intuition suggests that individuals may allow their Smartphones to do their thinking for them. Our account predicts that individuals who are relatively less willing and/or able to engage effortful reasoning processes may compensate by relying on the internet through their Smartphones. Across three studies, we find that those who think more intuitively and less analytically when given reasoning problems were more likely to rely on their Smartphones (i.e., extended mind) for information in their everyday lives. There was no such association with the amount of time using the Smartphone for social media and entertainment purposes, nor did boredom proneness qualify any of our results. These findings demonstrate that people may offload thinking to technology, which in turn demands that psychological science understand the meshing of mind and media to adequately characterize human experience and cognition in the modern era.",,"Smartphone use, Internet use, Cognitive miserliness, Dual-process theories, Extended mind, Situated cognition"

First, it was argued that divergent thinking tasks are similar to semantic fluency tasks, but are more constrained, and less well structured. Next, response time distributions from 54 participants were analyzed for temporal and semantic clustering. Participants responded to two prompts from the alternative uses test: uses for a brick and uses for a bottle, for two minutes each. Participants’ cumulative response curves were negatively accelerating, in line with theories of search of associative memory. However, results of analyses of semantic and temporal clustering suggested that clustering is less evident in alternative uses responding compared to semantic fluency tasks. This suggests either that divergent thinking responding does not involve an exhaustive search through a clustered memory trace, but rather that the process is more exploratory, yielding fewer overall responses that tend to drift away from close associates of the divergent thinking prompt.",,"Divergent thinking, Creativity, Memory search, Memory foraging, Semantic memory"

The solution of this task suggests modelling the information exchange between active objects. Modelling is supposed to be carried out within the framework of the basic applicative computing system, in which the code fragments can be modelled by applicative objects. An important part of the task is to check the correctness of the scenarios composition, which requires the tools make compositional thinking about data flows, both when they are processed by scripts and contain them. The correctness is proposed to be provided by supporting the fairly strong typing system that excludes incorrect combinations of scenarios. The type system is assumed to be immersed into the applicative environment. The system is proposed to be built on the basis of the homotopy type theory, which ensures, in particular, the introduction of independent and dependent types, as well as the definition of recursion and induction principles for them.

We demonstrate this approach by using a computational model of panic disorder to conduct an in silico dismantling study of cognitive behavioral therapy.

Findings indicate that females outperform males in CIL, while males excel in CT. Gender divides decrease as the percentiles of students’ proficiency levels increase. The explained portion of the gender divide in CIL and CT is consistently smaller than the unexplained portion across countries, suggesting that gender divide or unobserved factors may drive these divides. A comparison of OLS regression results with decomposition approaches indicates that the factors influencing digital literacy development differ from those contributing to the gender divide. Variation in the factors contributing to gender divides is greater across countries than within countries for both CIL and CT.

The aim of this study is to identify the factors that influence the creation of innovative ideas. We conducted two different types of workshops with 22 subjects and 23 subjects each. In the first workshop, subjects were asked to generate new business ideas through analogical thinking. As a result, half of the participants generated appropriate ideas, and three influential factors were determined: categorization skill, deliberation, and trial and error. The second workshop was designed to facilitate participants to enhance these three factors. As a result, 70% of the participants could generate appropriate ideas.

Thus, the aim of the present study was to explore the associations among inter-individual verbal creative thinking and both regional homogeneity and cortical morphology of the brain surface. We related the local functional homogeneity of spontaneous brain activity to verbal creative thinking and its dimensions—fluency, originality, and flexibility—by examining these inter-individual differences in a large sample of 268 healthy college students. Results revealed that people with high verbal creative ability and high scores for the three dimensions of creativity exhibited lower regional functional homogeneity in the right precuneus. Both cortical volume and thickness of the right precuneus were positively associated with individual verbal creativity and its dimensions. Moreover, originality was negatively correlated with functional homogeneity in the left superior frontal gyrus and positively correlated with functional homogeneity in the right occipito-temporal gyrus. In contrast, flexibility was positively correlated with functional homogeneity in the left superior and middle occipital gyrus. These findings provide additional evidence of a link between verbal creative thinking and brain structure in the right precuneus—a region involved in internally-focused attention and effective semantic retrieval—and further suggest that local functional homogeneity of verbal creative thinking has neurobiological relevance that is likely based on anatomical substrates.",,"Verbal creativity, Local functional homogeneity, Cortical morphology, Precuneus"

Data comes from a corpus study investigating the relationship between speech and gesture in two typologically different languages: Danish, a satellite-framed language and Italian, a verb-framed language. Results show cross-linguistic variation in how motion components are mapped onto linguistic constituents, but also show how Italian speakers to some degree deviate from standard verb-framed lexicalization patterns, and use typical satellite-framed constructions. Co-speech gestures, when they occur, largely follow the patterns used in speech, with a notable exception: In 28% of the cases, in fact, Italian speakers express manner in path-only speech constructions gesturally. This finding suggests that gestures may be instrumental in revealing what semantic components speakers attend to while speaking; in other words, purely verbal data may not fully account for the thinking part of the thinking-for-speaking hypothesis.",,"Thinking-for-speaking, Cross-linguistic variation, Conceptualization, Gesture"

Importantly, the issue of stimulus equivalence in developmental samples is much less of a problem in studies that use multiple indicators of cognitive sophistication, not just age differences. These multiple indicators can be used as converging evidence in triangulating developmental trends on rational thinking tasks. Age differences were obtained in childhood and early adolescence in the longitudinal developmental study, but not later in adolescence on all performance-based measures, including cognitive abilities and rational thinking tasks. Resistance to miserly information processing tasks can be used as an additional indicator of cognitive sophistication to correlate with response patterns on rational thinking tasks in developmental samples. Although such tasks do measure other aspects of process and knowledge (cognitive ability and numeracy), they also tap in part the participant’s ability to detect conflicts between normatively correct responses and rapidly emitted Type 1 processing. Task factors, particularly the process and knowledge demands of each rational thinking task, also contribute to explaining developmental patterns on these tasks. Identifying sources of cognitive failures on rational thinking tasks in children and youth can be mapped onto real-world correlates and provide new directions for training of these skills and abilities.",Academic Press,"Stimulus equivalence, Cognitive sophistication, Rational thinking, Development, Resistance to miserly information processing, Process and knowledge dimensions, Children and youth"

Here, we adapt methods from natural language processing (NLP) and computational text analysis to identify distinctive reasoning strategies in the rationales of top forecasters, including: (a) cognitive styles, such as dialectical complexity, that gauge tolerance of clashing perspectives and efforts to blend them into coherent conclusions and (b) the use of comparison classes or base rates to inform forecasts. In addition to these core metrics, we explore metrics derived from the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) program. Applying these tools to multiple tournaments and to forecasters of widely varying skill (from Mechanical Turkers to carefully culled “superforecasters”) revealed that: (a) top forecasters show higher dialectical complexity in their rationales and use more comparison classes; (b) experimental interventions, like training and teaming, that boost accuracy also influence NLP profiles of rationales, nudging them in a “superforecaster” direction.",,"Geopolitical forecasting, Psycholinguistic vocabularies, Integrative complexity, Comparison class, Natural language processing, LIWC"

Peirce developed a process philosophy featuring a non-theistic agapistic evolution from nothingness. It is an Eastern inspired alternative to the Western mechanical ontology of classical science also inspired by the American transcendentalists. Advaitism and Buddhism are the two most important Eastern philosophical traditions that encompass scientific knowledge and the idea of spontaneous evolutionary development. This article attempts to show how Peirce's non-mechanistic triadic semiotic process theory is suited better to embrace the quantum field view than mechanistic and information-based views are with regard to a theory of the emergence of consciousness. Peirce views the universe as a reasoning process developing from pure potentiality to the fully ordered rational Summon Bonum. The paper compares this with John Archibald Wheeler's “It from bit” cosmogony based on quantum information science, which leads to the info-computational view of nature, mind and culture. However, this theory lacks a phenomenological foundation. David Chalmers' double aspect interpretation of information attempts to overcome the limitations of the info-computational view. Chalmers supplements Batesonian and Wheelerian info-computationalism – both of which lack a phenomenological aspect - with a dimension that corresponds to the phenomenological aspect of reality. However, he does not manage to produce an integrated theory of the development of meaning and rationality. Alex Hankey's further work goes some way towards establishing a theory that can satisfy Husserl's criteria for consciousness - such as a sense of being and time - but Hankey's dependence on Chalmers' theory is still not able to account for what the connection between core consciousness and the physical world is.",,"Cosmogony, Peircean semiotic philosophy: cybersemiotics, Info-computationalism, It-from-bit cosmogony, Philosophy of science, Interdisciplinarity, Advaita Vedanta philosophy, Buddhist philosophy, Transcendentalists philosophy, Multi-universe theory, Developing laws, Irreversible time, Sustained criticality"

Our findings are that: (1) the emergence of new perspectives in a graphical dialogue map can be recognized by our coding scheme supported by a machine pattern-matching algorithm in a way that can be used to provide awareness indicators for moderators; (2) that the trigger events leading to the emergence of new perspectives in the online dialogues studied were most commonly disagreements and (3) the spatial representation of messages in a graphically mediated synchronous dialogue environment such as Digalo may offer more affordance for creativity than the much more common scrolling text chat environments. All these findings support the usefulness of our new account of creativity in online dialogues based on dialogic theory and demonstrate that this account can be operationalised through machine coding in a way that can be turned into alerts for moderators.",,"CSCL, Discourse analysis, Dialogic, Creativity, Artificial intelligence, Graphical interfaces"

It is necessary to design a design thinking learning framework that addresses independent learning and specific processes that will improve students' 21st-century skills. The existing literature has not implemented flipped programming courses from a design thinking perspective (Cook & Bush, 2018), which would thus be an innovative approach to designing teaching methods and investigating the effects of this framework. The purpose of this study was to develop analyze, observe, reflect, conceive, design, implement, and operate (Crawley et al., 2007) a DT-CDIO model and to investigate the relationship of the flow experience to computational thinking and cognitive load in order to understand the impact of the flow experience on a flipped programming course. The participants in this study comprised 40 pre-service education students (Male = 17; Female = 23). The partial least squares (PLS) method was used for the data analysis to test the model. This study was intended to obtain and evaluate significant differences between the students' flow experience and their computational thinking ability and cognitive load. The results indicated that the DT-CDIO pedagogy filled a long-standing gap related to a lack of reflective pedagogy and design thinking problems. The flow experience negatively impacted creativity and problem solving ability. Meanwhile, intrinsic cognitive load negatively impacted the flow experience. Germane cognitive load positively impacted the flow experience. In particular, the flow experience is a crucial factor that can be used to predict various computational thinking skills in a programming curriculum. More importantly, this study provides important insights into the implications of the DT-CDIO approach and other related factors.",,"Flipped classroom, Design thinking, Teaching/learning strategies, 21st-century abilities, Computational thinking"

Yet in practice, basic scientific research often treats “sex” as a single, internally consistent, and often binary variable. This practice occludes important physiological factors and processes, and thus limits the scientific value of our findings. In human-oriented biomedical research, the use of simplistic (and often binary) models of sex ignores the existence of intersex, trans, non-binary, and gender non-conforming people and contributes to a medical paradigm that neglects their needs and interests. More broadly, our collective reliance on these models legitimizes a false paradigm of human biology that undergirds harmful medical practices and anti-trans political movements. Herein, we continue the conversations begun at the SBN 2022 Symposium on Hormones and Trans Health, providing guiding questions to help scientists deconstruct and rethink the use of “sex” across the stages of the scientific method. We offer these as a step toward a scientific paradigm that more accurately recognizes and represents sexed physiologies as multiple, interacting, variable, and unbounded by gendered preconceptions.

In this context, the inputs to a computation are encoded as initial values of certain chemical species while the outputs are the limiting values of other chemical species. In this paper, we design chemical systems that carry out the elementary arithmetic computations of: identification, inversion, mth roots (for m≥2), addition, multiplication, absolute difference, rectified subtraction over non-negative real numbers, and partial real inversion over real numbers. We prove that these “elementary modules” have a speed of computation that is independent of the inputs to the computation. Moreover, we prove that finite sequences of such elementary modules, running in parallel, can carry out composite arithmetic over real numbers, also at a rate that is independent of inputs. Furthermore, we show that the speed of a composite computation is precisely the speed of the slowest elementary step. Specifically, the scale of the composite computation, i.e. the number of elementary steps involved in the composite, does not affect the overall asymptotic speed – a feature of the parallel computing nature of our algorithm. Our proofs require the careful mathematical analysis of certain non-autonomous systems, and we believe this analysis will be useful in different areas of applied mathematics, dynamical systems, and the theory of computation.

This is one of the fundamental questions of research on personal identity. To date, this literature has focused on identifying the psychological states (e.g., moral beliefs, memories) that people rely on when making identity judgments. But the notion of personal identity depends on more than just psychological states. Most people also believe that the physical matter that makes up an individual is an important criterion for judging identity; changes to the physical stuff in a person’s body, even if they are not accompanied by any psychological changes, are judged to change who the person is at some level. Here, we investigate the sources of these beliefs and propose that they stem from the broader cognitive tendency to assume that unseen physical essences make things what they are—psychological essentialism. Four studies provided support for this claim. In Studies 1 and 2, exposing participants to essentialist reasoning led to stronger endorsement of physical continuity as a criterion for personal identity. Similarly, individual differences in participants’ essentialist thinking predicted the extent of their reliance on physical continuity (Study 3), and this relationship was observed even among 6- to 9-year-old children (Study 4). These studies advance theory on the psychology of personal identity by identifying a reason why people assign a central role to physical composition when judging identity.",,"Essentialism, Identity, Development, Self, Philosophy"

Further, we expected that ML would be successful at classifying more (vs. less) creative individuals.

Drug repurposing, computational chemistry, and Artificial Intelligence-assisted approaches are new and novel way of thinking toward the development of anticancer drugs. Drug repurposing with AI can develop a novel effective and specific anticancer drug for the treatment of cancer. The application of AI helps to diagnose the actual cause of cancerous development in the patient and also to determine the doses of effective drugs to be applied for particular cancer. AI together with computational chemistry provides an enhancement to the medical system for the effective diagnosis and treatment of cancer.",Academic Press,"Artificial Intelligence, Computational chemistry, Drug repurposing, Anticancer therapeutics, Machine learning, Deep learning"

The terms can be made more serviceable by distinguishing between definitions by extension and definitions by intension. Difficulties with the term ‘intensification’ are addressed by considering the System of Rice Intensification (SRI). This reverses Green Revolution thinking about intensification as a matter of increasing material inputs. Changes in crop management can raise food output by reducing such inputs, with increased reliance on knowledge and management that use available resources more productively and sustainably. Its initial increases in labor inputs are usually transitory. Conjunctions of different disciplines and different levels of analysis and action are considered with reference to the factors of nestedness and contingence. Subjects bearing on sustainable intensification which can benefit from disciplinary convergence include: biogeochemistry to address problems of climate change; part-time farming to adapt to changing economic opportunities; and symbiotic endophytes that can enhance crop health and growth. The concept of ‘causation’ is disaggregated to consider ‘processual’ as distinguished from ‘mechanistic’ causation. Systems thinking is likely to be more productive for addressing interactions within and between subsystems rather than for theorizing about systems as a whole.",,

Importantly, the same circuit can have multiple points of failure, each of which results in a different type of dysregulation, and thus elicits distinct cascades downstream that produce divergent signs and symptoms. Here, we illustrate this challenge by examining how subtle differences in circuit perturbations can lead to divergent clinical outcomes. We also discuss how computational models can perform the spatially heterogeneous integration and bridge in vitro and in vivo paradigms. By leveraging recent methodological advances and tools, computational models can integrate relevant processes across scales (e.g., tricarboxylic acid cycle, ion channel, neural microassembly, whole-brain macrocircuit) and across physiological systems (e.g., neural, endocrine, immune, vascular), providing a framework that can unite these mechanistic processes in a manner that goes beyond the conceptual and descriptive to the quantitative and generative.

The graph structure is a typical tool used to formulate such correlations, it is incapable of modeling high-order correlations among different objects in systems; thus, the graph structure cannot fully convey the intricate correlations among objects. Confronted with the aforementioned two challenges, hypergraph computation models high-order correlations among data, knowledge, and rules through hyperedges and leverages these high-order correlations to enhance the data. Additionally, hypergraph computation achieves collaborative computation using data and high-order correlations, thereby offering greater modeling flexibility. In particular, we introduce three types of hypergraph computation methods: ① hypergraph structure modeling, ② hypergraph semantic computing, and ③ efficient hypergraph computing. We then specify how to adopt hypergraph computation in practice by focusing on specific tasks such as three-dimensional (3D) object recognition, revealing that hypergraph computation can reduce the data requirement by 80% while achieving comparable performance or improve the performance by 52% given the same data, compared with a traditional data-based method. A comprehensive overview of the applications of hypergraph computation in diverse domains, such as intelligent medicine and computer vision, is also provided.

Yet, despite the many recent efforts in cross-cultural comparisons, two key questions remain underaddressed: are current methodologies in the psychology of thinking inherently biased toward explaining Western behavior?

This gap in AI literacy primary school education presents theoretical and pedagogical challenges. Despite the pervasive influence of AI, which can exacerbate inequalities and raise ethical challenges, primary students often lack an understanding of AI principles and mechanisms. Recent developments in age-appropriate AI learning tools have extended AI literacy to primary schools, but AI literacy frameworks for this age group remain underdeveloped. This study aims to conceptualize AI literacy by analyzing existing theoretical frameworks and proposing a new inclusive AI literacy framework for young students. A scoping review is employed using four credible index databases, and 19 articles are selected, with 17 AI literacy frameworks identified across all educational levels, from early childhood to university. This study reveals that the predominant methodologies for developing AI literacy frameworks involve empirical research studies and literature reviews, adhering to national government or institutional standards. These frameworks commonly incorporate 1) Bloom's taxonomy or a similar progression framework, such as Use-Create-Modify, 2) constructionism, and 3) computer science perspectives such as theories of computation. The findings reveal that AI literacy is situated at the intersection of digital literacy, data literacy, computational thinking, and AI ethics, emphasizing the need for a transdisciplinary and interdisciplinary approach that encompasses both technological and societal impacts. However, the study argues that the current paradigms of AI literacy frameworks for young students often emphasize constructionist perspectives without fully considering the interactions between human and technological agents. This gap highlights the necessity for a new conceptual framework that acknowledges both human and non-human agents in AI literacy education for young students.

In this study, the conceptual model CISTA-A (CISTA for Agro-ecosystems) is developed using Indicators that are identified as using a Systems Thinking approach to Adaptation. CISTA addresses questions concerning “how to adapt” our ecosystems to climate change and has three or more layers: A base (element) layer has abiotic/biotic information (e.g. ecological, agro-hydrological, and meteorological data). One or more components (intermediate) layer(s) have ecological, agro-hydrological, and climatological indicators (e.g. length of the growing season and growing degree days) that affect the ecosystem. Indicators are identified and estimated from an element layer. In the final layer, the translation of information from indicators to adaptation strategies (incremental systems and transformational adaptation) depends on the degree of change and the level of adaptation. CISTA can stand alone or combine with existing crop/integrated assessment models to develop quantitative adaptation strategies. The use of 23 indicators and 3 empirical tests in the agro-ecosystems (AS) of Kansas, USA demonstrate the application of CISTA-A.",,"Adaptation strategies, Kansas agriculture, Climate change impacts, Conceptual model, Ogallala aquifer, Hard and soft systems thinking, Inductive and deductive approach"

Previous evidence indicates that suppressing retrieval, which recruits executive control mechanisms to prevent unwanted memories entering consciousness, can cause forgetting, termed suppression-induced forgetting (SIF). Since these executive mechanisms involve multiple mental operations, we hypothesize that the efficacy of SIF may be limited by individuals’ capacity limitation of cognitive control. Here, we tested this hypothesis. Participants were assigned to two groups based on the median of their cognitive control capacity (CCC, estimated by the backward masking majority function task) and performed the think/no-think task with electrophysiological signals recorded. The results showed that the SIF effect was observed only in the high CCC group but not in the low CCC group. In accordance, repeated suppression attempts also resulted in a steeper reduction in intrusive thoughts in the high CCC group. Furthermore, ERP analysis revealed a decrease in recollection-related late parietal positivity (LPP) under the no-think condition in the high CCC group. A mediation analysis revealed that the reduced intrusive memories mediated the effect of CCC on SIF. These findings suggest that suppressing retrieval could reduce traces of the unwanted memories, making them less intrusive and harder to recall. More importantly, successful SIF is constrained by the capacity of cognitive control which may be used to ensure the coordination of multiple cognitive processes during suppression.",,"Cognitive control, Memory suppression, Think/no-think paradigm, Intrusion, Cognitive control capacity"

Structural equation modeling revealed that both associations positively predicted DT originality and switch distance, but controlled association negatively impacted DT fluency. Regression analyses showed that associative abilities did not directly predict creative behaviors and controlled association negatively impacted creative self-efficacy. Instead, these traits were primarily predicted by the quantity of DT responses.

Thoughts can be temporally abstract and relate to long term goals, or past or future events, or relationally abstract and focus on the relationships between representations rather than simple stimulus features. Behavioural studies have provided evidence of a prolonged development of the cognitive functions associated with RLPFC, in particular logical and relational reasoning, but also episodic memory retrieval and prospective memory. Functional and structural neuroimaging studies provide further support for a prolonged development of RLPFC during adolescence, with some evidence of increased specialisation of RLPFC activation for relational integration and aspects of episodic memory retrieval.

But these choices typically do not conform the behavioural norms specified by conventional economics for rational behaviour and, therefore, for rational choices. Smart thinking encompasses behaviour that is based on what the individuals deem to be the best path towards achieving their objectives. This behaviour is heavily affected by their decision-making environment as well as their decision-making capabilities, neither of which need be ideal nor fit for purpose. Smart thinking and smart decision-making therefore overlap with the concepts of bounded rationality and satisficing developed by Simon. But smart thinking or broadly rational behaviour might very well appear to be irrational from the prism of conventional economics because they typically don’t conform to conventional behavioural norms for rationality. I also argue, flowing upon Gigerenzer’s fast and frugal heuristics narrative, that adhering to these conventional behavioural norms can result in sub-optimal outcomes from the point of view of the individual decision-maker. Indeed, adopting different behavioural norms and making different choices often yield better outcomes. Being neoclassically rational can actually yield sub-optimal or inefficient outcomes. Ultimately, optimal decision-making norms is context dependent—one size does not fit all. These norms can involve either slow or fast thinking (Kahneman), dependent on circumstance. Also, in the smart thinking narrative errors and biases in decision-making can still take place, but they are correctable through experience and appropriate changes in decision-making capabilities and the decision-making environment. The latter can also correct for any externalities that are often part and parcel of smart or rational decision-making.

A robust quantitative understanding of variability is particularly important during data analysis, where statistics are used to quantify variation and draw conclusions about phenomena while accounting for variation. Many students struggle to correctly apply a quantitative understanding of variation to statistically analyze data. We present quantitative and qualitative analyses of introductory biology students’ responses on two pairs of multiple-choice questions querying two concepts related to the quantitative analysis of variation. More students correctly identify a mathematical expression of variation than correctly interpret it. Many students correctly interpret a nonsignificant p-value in the context of a very small sample size, but fewer students do so in the context of a large sample size. These results imply that many students have an incomplete quantitative understanding of variation. These findings suggest that instruction focusing on conceptual understanding, not procedural problem solving, may elevate students’ quantitative understanding of variation.",,"education, assessments, statistics, undergraduate, variation"

In this study, we constructed macromolecular models of highly metamorphic coal, and relative dynamic simulations under experiment and field conditions are performed. The corresponding CH4 storage capacity and spatial coordination distribution of the coal after five treatments were derived. Combined with the results of the micropore filling theory, it was shown that the equilibrium distance of CH4 filling in the micropore increased with the degree of extraction (from 0.351 nm for XT to 0.572 nm for XT-DMF). Also, the trend of CH4 adsorption position in the representative samples (the number of monolayer affixations decreased from 10 to 9) provides crucial support for the conclusions, and the low-potential region with a high potential difference contributes to CH4 stability. The breakthrough of this study will provide strong support and a solid theoretical basis for the efficient and safe exploitation of CBM (Coalbed methane) energy resources.",,"CH storage, Highly metamorphic coal, Coal organic components, Molecular dynamic simulation, Filling balanced distance"

However, few studies to date have defined problem solving, and investigated how it is operationalised in interdisciplinary creative coding tasks. This study aims to build knowledge about students’ use of computational thinking and computer science concepts for problem solving when coding animated narratives. The research investigated students’ coding processes using data gathered from audio and device display recordings and semi-structured interviews. Results suggest limitations to the use of creative coding tasks if the expectation is to develop computational thinking and systematic problem solving strategies, or learn basic computer science concepts. They revealed that novice students rarely solved coding problems using optimal technically-based strategies despite being given explicit instruction on their use, opting instead to bypass problems by adjusting intended outcomes, or by using low level code translation strategies. Results demonstrate that engaging computational thinking or even demonstrating understanding of basic computer science concepts was not a requirement to produce a viable creative coding outcome. This study contributes new understanding of students’ coding practices when engaged in creative coding tasks in regular, non-specialist classrooms. Its findings challenge the commonly-held assumption that coding is a natural ‘vehicle’ to develop computational thinking and systematic approaches to problem solving. It also questions the learning that results from the non-technical, inefficient and often ineffective problem solving practices students employ during ‘creative coding’ tasks, that are frequently used by non-specialist teachers in response to curriculum requirements.",,"Problem solving, Computational thinking, Tinkering, Coding, Middle-school"

That allowed evaluation of new games not yet played and later led to a more abstract conception of probability as a measure satisfying certain conditions (‘axioms’). Only in the past 150 years or so has probability had a major role in science and only in the last 50 years or so in everyday life – as, for example, in evaluating medical outcomes or technological risks or manufacturer liability. Thus, especially in attempting to assess probability in everyday situations, our intuitions are often deficient – more so than those concerning quantity, space, and time. The major problem is not, however, one of making random errors in probability judgments but of making systematic ones that result from a number of well-known and research systematic cognitive biases and heuristics, which are described in this article. These systematic departures from rational assessment do not imply that coherent and accurate probabilistic thinking is (anywhere near) impossible, but that when departures from coherence and accuracy occur, they tend to follow a predictable pattern.",Elsevier,"Chance, Heuristics, Information theory, Risk, Thought"

Examples of problems and their solutions by students in a Year 7 primary classroom will be presented and analysed to highlight how a deeper investigation of mathematical problems can instigate student discourse that encourages general ways of thinking underpinning algebraic reasoning rather than simply using particular strategies or procedures for classes of problems. The results obtained so far suggest that students are able to build general ways of thinking that will lead them to an algebraic perspective of mathematics beyond the mechanics and procedures often associated with algebra.

However, studies that found cultural difference in attribution process may have non-equivalence problems that make it hard to interpret the causal relationship between thinking style and attribution process. The present research extends this by measuring participants’ thinking style within a single culture in order to ensure equivalence on potentially confounding variables such as prior knowledge and cognitive capacity. Two experiments demonstrate that both types of thinkers have identical attribution processes and suggest different thinking styles might relate to different tendencies toward situational information, but not to the attribution process itself.",,"Attribution, Dual-process theory of cognition, Cognitive style, Cross-cultural differences, Holistic thinking"

Common challenges associated with generation and evaluation of system functional architectures include search of the expansive design space and assessment of key performance attributes that are particularly “fuzzy” and qualitative in early architecture development. Several assessment approaches have been presented in the literature to address the assessment challenge to include Quality Function Deployment (QFD), Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), Value-Focused Thinking (VFT), and fuzzy logic. In this research we combine the use of value functions and fuzzy assessment to assess a functional and system architecture. There are several benefits of a methodology that combines value-focused thinking and fuzzy assessment. A distinct advantage of the methodology presented is the explicit inclusion of the customer in the assessment process through validation of the TPM value functions Involving the customer in TPM value function development and validation ensures the customer has direct input regarding the TPMs and their associated value across the range of discourse The methodology presented is flexible enough to assess architectures early in the process when things are “fuzzy” as well as later when subsystem and component performance are well defined. The methodology can also be used to analyze and assess impacts of interface changes within the system architecture. . The methodology is domain independent and can be coupled with executable models linked to scenarios. The assessment methodology is applied to the architecture for a soldier knowledge acquisition system for which the key performance attributes are affordability, performance, flexibility, updateability, and availability.",,"Architecture, Assessment, Fuzzy Systems, Value Focused Thinking"

In addition to physical security, cyber security becomes a significant concern for NPPs since swift digitalization and overreliance on computer-based systems in the facility operations transformed NPPs into targets for cyber/physical attacks. Despite technical competencies, humans are still the central component of a resilient NPP to develop an effective nuclear security culture. Turkey is one of the newcomers in the nuclear energy industry, and Turkish Akkuyu NPP has a unique model owned by an international consortium. Since Turkey has limited experience in nuclear energy industry, specific multinational and multicultural characteristics of Turkish Akkuyu NPP also requires further research in terms of the Facility's prospective nuclear security. Yet, the link between “national cultures” and “nuclear security” is underestimated in nuclear security studies. By relying on Hofstede's national culture framework, our research aims to address this gap and explore possible implications of cross-national cultural differences on nuclear security.

The approach is compatible with sustainability management frameworks as it follows the well-known iterative process of planning, doing, checking and improving. The framework involves three main steps: analysis of current situation with respect to circular economy within the organisation; stakeholder engagement to get a buy-in and inform the development of a circular economy strategy; and implementation of the strategy following the guidelines provided within the framework. Application of the framework is illustrated through a case of the University of Manchester, demonstrating how circular economy principles can be used to benchmark existing sustainability policies and action plans. The paper also shows how engaging key stakeholders can be used to identify challenges and opportunities for embedding circular economy thinking into the university's sustainability management systems.

For higher-inhibition individuals, no changes in upper alpha activity from Epoch 1 to Epoch 2 were found.

This work presents an integrated framework for MEC and Industry 5.0, aimed at enhancing the performance, efficiency, and flexibility of industrial processes. In particular, we propose a joint optimization problem that maximizes computational energy efficiency by optimally allocating resources, such as processing power and computational resources, as well as device association, in the most efficient manner possible. The problem is formulated as nonconvex/nonlinear, which is intractable and poses high complexity. To solve this challenging problem, we first transform and decouple the original optimization problem into a series of subproblems using the block coordinate descent method. Then, we iteratively obtain an efficient solution using convex optimization methods. In addition, our work sheds light on the fundamental trade-off between local computation and partial offloading schemes. The results show that for small data size requirements, the performance is comparable among different schemes. However, as data size increases, our proposed hybrid scheme, which includes a partial offloading scheme, outperforms others, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed joint optimization scheme.",,"Industry 5.0, Mobile edge computing, Joint optimization, Computational energy efficiency, Partial offloading"

This study investigated whether doctors' preferences for a rational thinking style or an experiential thinking style are associated with hand hygiene compliance. Methods This was an observational study of hand hygiene practices of 32 doctors in 2 teaching hospitals in South Australia. Compliance rates were correlated with self-reported thinking styles. The doctors were observed by a trained observer during a ward round or outpatient clinic and were unaware that hand hygiene was under observation. The main outcome measures were hand hygiene compliance (hand hygiene compliance tool) and thinking style (Rational-Experiential Inventory). Results An overall mean compliance rate of 7.6% (standard deviation ± 7.2%) was found. Compliance was significantly positively correlated with experiential/automatic thinking (r = .46; P = .004) and the observational setting of ward rounds (vs clinics) (r = -.47; P = .003). No significant relationship was found between compliance and a rational/deliberate thinking style (r = -.01; P = .472). Conclusions Hand hygiene is more experiential than rational. Findings suggest that certain promotional strategies appealing to the experiential thinking mode may improve compliance, and that traditional approaches based on logic and reasoning alone probably will not work.",,

In the USA, for example, nearly one in three adults espouse a literal and recent divine creation account of human origins. Plausibly, resistance to scientific conclusions regarding the origins of species—like much resistance to other scientific conclusions (Bloom & Weisberg, 2007)—gains support from reliably developing intuitions. Intuitions about essentialism, teleology, agency, and order may combine to make creationism potentially more cognitively attractive than evolutionary concepts. However, dual process approaches to cognition recognize that people can often analytically override their intuitions. Two large studies (total N=1324) found consistent evidence that a tendency to engage analytic thinking predicted endorsement of evolution, even controlling for relevant demographic, attitudinal, and religious variables. Meanwhile, exposure to religion predicted reduced endorsement of evolution. Cognitive style is one factor among many affecting opinions on the origin of species.",,"Evolution, Creationism, Dual process theories, Supernatural beliefs, Cognitive style"

It is well known that enhanced visual function in striate and extrastriate areas is a common character in autists, savants and subjects with Asperger syndrome. In addition, visual cortex not only processes visual signals but also is involved in the processing of mathematical thinking and auditory signals among them. Here we argue about the essential (and more ancient) role of picture representation over linguistic representation in ASD and that extraordinary savant-like skills are due to the explicit predominance of the right hemisphere (a malfunction of top-down control processes) accompanied with prevalence of lower level detailed visual information in the right hemisphere. Our recently presented novel biophysical picture representation hypothesis (also called as intrinsic biophysical virtual visual reality) about visual perception and imagery is also briefly described and linked to the predominance of lower level and detailed visual representation in the right hemisphere that may be a common character in autism, savantism, and Asperger syndrome.",,"Autism, Savantism, Asperger syndrome, Biophysical pictures, Thinking in pictures"

Although this heuristic bias is well documented and widely featured in psychology textbooks, its precise nature is less clear. A key question is whether reasoners detect the biased nature of their judgments. My research is focusing on this detection process. In a nutshell, results indicate that despite their illogical response, people demonstrate a remarkable sensitivity to possible conflict between their heuristic judgment and elementary logical or probabilistic principles. In this chapter, I present a detailed overview of the empirical studies that I have run and discuss theoretical implications. I will clarify why the empirical detection findings have led me to hypothesize that people not only have heuristic intuitions but also logical intuitions. I also explore implications for ongoing debates concerning our view of human rationality (“Are humans blind and ignorant heuristic thinkers?”), dual process theories of reasoning (“How do intuitive and deliberate thinking interact?”), and the nature of individual differences in bias susceptibility (“when and why do biased and unbiased reasoners start to diverge?”).",Academic Press,"Biases, Conflict Detection, Decision-making, Dual Systems, Error detection, Heuristics, Reasoning"

Customer requirements are recognized as a key driver in business. The airline is the principal customer for the aircraft manufacture. The passenger is, in turn, the airline's principal customer but they are just one of several stakeholders that include aviation authorities, airport operators, air-traffic control and security agencies. The passenger experience is a key differentiator used by airlines to attract and retain custom and the fuselage that defines the cabin envelope for the in-flight passenger experience and cabin design therefore receives significant attention for new aircraft, service updates and refurbishments. Decision making in design is crucial to arriving at viable and worthwhile cabin formats. Too little innovation will result in an aircraft manufacturer and airlines using its products falling behind its competitors. Too much may result in an over-extension with, for example, use of immature technologies that do not have the necessary reliability for a safety critical industry or sufficient value to justify the development effort. The multiple requirements associated with cabin design, can be viewed as an area for optimisation, accepting trade-offs between the various parameters. Good design, however, is often defined as developing a concept that resolves the contradictions and takes the solution towards a win-win scenario. Indeed our understanding and practice of design allows for behaviors that enhance design thinking through divergence and convergence, the use of abductive reasoning, experimentation and systems thinking. This paper explores and defines the challenges of designing the aircraft cabin of the future that will deliver on the multiple requirements using experiences from the A350 XWB and future cabin design concepts. In particular the paper explores the value of implementing design thinking insights in engineering practice and discusses the relative merits of decisions based on optimisation versus win-win scenarios for aircraft cabin design and wider applications in aerospace environments. The increasing densification of technological opportunities and shifting consumer demand coupled with highly complex systems may ultimately challenge our ability to make decisions based on optimisation balances. From an engineering design perspective optimisation tends to preclude certain strategies that deliver high quality results in consumer scenarios whereas win-win solutions may face challenges in complex technical environments.",,"Aircraft, Cabin, Design, Optimisation, Parameter, Decision"

As an ideation tool, analogical thinking enables conceptual change, which is seen as a crucial aspect of creativity. In this regard, the use of analogy can be an important instrument to facilitate novel idea generation. Analogies are generated by superficial or structural similarities from the memory. For creating a new idea by analogy, this study regards novelty as the domain-changing influenced by structural consistency with the source ideas. Consequently, we designed an assessment framework based on the latent semantic analysis of the domains and the consistency of the underlying mechanism between the source and the new ideas. Data was collected from the 14 subjects who participated in the workshop for this study. The workshop consists of three tasks: 1) Pre-task: All subjects were asked to read the 25 cases of the collective intelligence services, which is a business model creating value from large and loosely organized groups of people working together electronically e.g. Amazon.com, Google Japanese input; 2) Categorization task: Subjects were asked to categorize each case based on the underlying mechanism of the business through group discussion; 3) Generation task: Subjects were asked to create a new service idea individually using analogical thinking. As a result, 12 ideas were created, 6 of which were assessed as novel according to our assessment framework. Among the remaining 6 ideas, 4 were assessed as having high superficial similarity in terms of the idea domain, and 2 as having neither superficial nor structural similarity with the source ideas. Although our findings suggest that the proposed assessment framework for novelty evaluation is unable to provide a ‘one-size fits-all method’, it does enable us to overcome some of the limitations of current evaluation methods which depend on subjective judgements for rating.",,"analogical thinking, novelty of ideas, assessment framworks, innovation workshops, ideation for innovation"

We collected 30 computational kits, including 13 physical kits, 8 virtual kits, and 9 hybrid kits, and performed a qualitative analysis of these kits. We examined the kits across four different perspectives: how they are designed, how they support children to explore computational concepts and practices, how they enable children to engage in a range of projects and activities, and how they enable children to explore other domains of knowledge. Based on the analysis, we present design suggestions and opportunities to expand the possibilities in what computational ideas and other domains of knowledge children can explore, how children can engage in computing, and what kinds of projects children can make. While many kits enable the exploration of some computational concepts and practices, we see opportunities to expand how these concepts can be supported, as well as the new concepts and domains children could explore. We also see possibilities to include new modes of expression such as body motion or new media such as light and sound. Finally, we see possibilities for whom designers can better support, such as more explicit roles for adult caregivers and expanding possibilities for children from underrepresented groups in computing.

Based on the analysis of more than 100 storms across six consecutive hydrological years, our results demonstrate that either pre-event soil water content or rainfall conditions alone are not sufficient to explain the slope response. Seasonality played a major role through soil moisture conditions, and pre-event soil moisture, peak rainfall intensity and rainfall duration influenced the slope runoff response. Observations suggest that in fall and winter subsurface flow was the prevalent runoff mechanism, while infiltration excess overland flow mostly occurred in the dry season. Our findings show that continuous measurement of runoff could be beneficial to understand the peak rainfall-peak runoff relationship.",,"Peak runoff, Peak rainfall, Hillslope, Storm response, Soil moisture, Hydrological response"

None of the many conceptual paradigms that have been proposed so far to explain it has turned out entirely satisfactory. We argue that the main reason behind this failure is the implicit linear thinking that informs all these approaches: namely, the idea that a few, major drivers explain urban development through a direct, clearly readable systemic impact. Cities are complex socio-environmental systems whose functioning depends on the concurrent interaction of many different factors which cannot be reduced to the action of a few, simple causal forces. Failing to understand such complexity easily leads to dysfunctional urban governance approaches. In this paper, we analyze a database of 144 European cities as described by 58 variables belonging to different domains, as designed by a preliminary stage of the Cultural and Creative City Monitor (CCCM). Our analysis builds on innovative machine learning techniques (PST) and on the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) representation to map the structural interdependencies between the cultural and non-cultural sectors in cities with a strong cultural policy orientation.

While most of this literature focuses on domain specific relations (i.e., how math anxiety impacts thinking about mathematics), in the current work we examine important relations between math anxiety and domain general factors. Specifically, we test three hypotheses: (1) that higher-math-anxious individuals have a lower need for and enjoyment of exerting cognitive effort, (2) that math anxiety mediates a relation between ones’ propensity for cognitive effort and their achievement in mathematics, and (3) that higher-math-anxious individuals are less reflective in their thinking, and that this is not limited to questions that are heavily reliant on mathematical reasoning. As predicted, we uncovered relations between math anxiety and the domain-general constructs of need for cognition and cognitive reflection. Importantly, these negative relations hold even after controlling for math ability, general anxiety, and gender of the participant. The results are discussed in terms of implications for our understanding of the construct of math anxiety. Proficiency in mathematics is a major advantage in industrialised nations. Unfortunately, many people experience math-anxiety (Richardson & Suinn, 1972), becoming nervous when engaging in math tasks and avoiding math and math-related professions. As a result, those with math anxiety tend to severely limit their future career and earning opportunities (Chipman, Krantz, & Silver, 1992; Hembree, 1990). The resulting shortage of adults prepared to work in the sciences, technology, engineering, and mathematics field (STEM) has negative consequences at the national level, particularity as societies become increasingly dependent upon technology (Beilock & Maloney, 2015; Chipman et al., 1992; Maloney & Beilock, 2012). Worldwide, increased math-anxiety is linked to decreased math achievement (Foley et al., 2017; Lee, 2009), and this is not limited to academic situations. Math-anxious nurses, for example, are more likely than non-math-anxious nurses to make poor drug calculations (Mcmullan, Jones, & Lea, 2012); math-anxious women are more likely than their peers to engage in poor financial planning (McKenna & Nickols, 1988), and math anxiety is negatively linked to the ability to interpret health statistics (Silk & Parrott, 2014). Given that math-anxiety is related to important and detrimental consequences in people’s daily lives, it is vital that we work to understand the behavioural and cognitive differences between those who are high and low in math-anxiety.",,"Math anxiety, Cognitive reflection test, Need for cognition"

Decision-making based on such scenarios bears the risk of missing undesired impacts on specific groups of people, which may cause social tensions or require costly countermeasures. New approaches are needed to provide a better basis for socially responsible planning by making clearer the complex social impacts of future scenarios. In marketing and user-centered design, persona models are developed to represent typologies of users to cover a broad range of needs and requirements. We propose a systematic method, called the Scenario Personarrative method, for combining scenario thinking and personas into a structured but nonetheless flexible process, which allows generating fine-grained individualized narratives. We describe a pilot application in a case study on urban mobility. This pilot used existing scenarios and focused on a two-hour workshop where twelve experts created personas and the associated narratives across three scenarios of urban mobility in 2030. This pilot shows the applicability of the method for making potential effects on different social groups more tangible.

We found that cortisol impaired performance in the CRT by biasing responses toward intuitive, but incorrect answers. Elevated stimulation of the noradrenergic system, however, had no effect.

Kagome is a trihexagonal pattern employed in traditional bamboo basketry as a triaxial weaving system, resulting in an object with a self-bracing capacity without the use of fasteners owing to its interlacing lattices. Although existing studies and tools have addressed triaxial weaving design and representation, the current consideration of the advantages of weaving with bamboo is insufficient. To address this research gap, this study develops a computational design method based on studies on bamboo basketry. This allows for the representation and exploration of design geometries using combinations of regular triangular meshes for the fabrication of Kagome woven bamboo artifacts. A full-scale mock-up was fabricated to evaluate the effectiveness of the method. The mock-up demonstrated the self-bracing properties of Kagome, but there were discrepancies between the mock-up and the design.

His ideas about social evolution, the design of local communities, and his repeated calls for comprehensive understanding through regional survey and plan laid the groundwork for much practical planning in the mid 20th century, both with respect to an embryonic theory of cities and the practice of planning. But Geddes had a much wider agenda that town planning per se. He sought after a philosophy of life that went well beyond Darwinism verging almost on the spiritual at times. Yet his personal approach and the limits he imposed on his formal thinking meant that he was never able to establish his big picture in a way that later generations could easily grasp and build upon. He left us with enticing ideas, evocative phrases, and a practical philosophy of doing planning and building communities that has indeed survived as something more than a footnote in history. In this essay, we identify the key paradox of modern planning which seeks to intervene in systems that have enormous complexity, growing and evolving rather than being designed in any top-down fashion. We illustrate this paradox through Geddes’ own career and life in which this tension between bottom up and top down was always to the forefront. We then sketch his influence on practicing planners and key intellectuals of the mid to late 20th century—Abercrombie and Mumford, Jacobs and Alexander. We bring this history of Geddes’ influence up to contemporary times when the complexity sciences with all their focus on evolving systems, now permeate our thinking, suggesting various ways in which we might examine the history of the planning in the last 100 years in a new light through the lens of Geddes’ arguments and principles",,"Evolution, Darwinism, Organic growth, Top-down planning, Bottom-up action, Complexity sciences"

Unlike traditional chemotherapy, which displays predictable dose-exposure relationships resulting from well-understood pharmacokinetic processes, CAR T-cell dynamics rely on complex biologic factors that condition treatment response. Computational approaches hold potential to explore the intricate cellular dynamics arising from CAR T therapy, yet their ability to improve cancer treatment remains elusive. Here we present a comprehensive framework through which to understand, construct, and classify CAR T-cell kinetics models. Current approaches often rely on adapted empirical pharmacokinetic methods that overlook dynamics emerging from cellular interactions, or intricate theoretical multi-population models with limited clinical applicability.

Constructal law is the thermodynamic theory based on the analysis of fluxes across the boundaries of an open system. Protocells, as dynamic, autopoietic and adaptive open finite size systems, serve in this paper as a compelling metaphor and design model for responsive and sustainable manmade architectural and urban environments. The ability of protocells to harness energy, minimize entropy, and adapt to environmental changes mirrors the principles of constructal thermodynamics, which govern the flow and distribution of resources in complex self-organizing information open systems in nature. By applying these principles to digital architecture, this study investigates how relational dynamics between spaces, materials, and functions can create adaptive designs that “go with the flow” of ecological and cultural systems. The research demonstrates using the Gouy-Stodola theorem as a variational principle, how protocell-inspired processes facilitate exergy-efficient designs, minimizing waste while maximizing resilience and flexibility. The present paper argues -through an applied case study- for a paradigm where protocell digital architecture serves not only as an ecological and material model but mainly as a spatial narrative driver, blending constructal and digital tools with cultural mythos. Finally, this paper exploring simultaneously the semantic complexity and ontology of such systems, in turn, connects these constructal driven digital designs to broader poly-narratives, embedding cultural, symbolic, philosophical and functional predicates into architectural forms.",,"Complexity, constructal law, Exergy, Energy, Subject, Predicate, Gouy-Stodola theorem, Entropy, Heterotopia"

We have previously named this method SIBA Actuated Nanopore Electrophoresis (SANE) sensing and have shown its ability to perform concurrent optical and DC electrical measurements. Here, we extend this method to AC sensing of 20 nm SiO2 (silica) nanoparticles, using voltage modulation over a wide range of frequencies applied on top of a baseline DC bias.

These simulations computed conductance changes and phase shifts induced by the presence of the nanoparticle over an AC frequency range of 20 Hz to 100 kHz. Experimental measurements confirmed the trends seen in the computational data.

Internally generated (‘detached’) cognition may have evolved in part because of its contributions to this broad function, but important questions remain about its role in threat management. In this article, we therefore present a taxonomy of threat-related internally generated cognition comprising episodic and semantic formats of memory and prospection. We address the proximate mechanisms of each of the capacities in this taxonomy, and discuss their respective contributions to adaptive threat management in humans. For instance, mental time travel empowers people to contemplate and learn from threats experienced long ago, as well as to plan for dangers that might arise in the distant future. However, despite their functional benefits, these thought processes are also central to contemporary anxiety disorders and may be a potent source of distress.",,"Episodic foresight, Episodic memory, Semantic memory, Mental time travel, Threat detection, Anxiety, Worry, Evolution, Evolutionary psychology, Counterfactual thinking"

In this review, we survey some of the curricula, materials, and resources for instructors who want to include theory, simulation, and computation in the undergraduate curriculum. There has been a notable progression from teaching students to use discipline-specific computational tools to developing interactive computational tools that promote active learning to having students write code themselves, such that they view computation as another tool for solving problems. We are moving toward a future where computational skills, including programming, data analysis, visualization, and simulation, will no longer be considered an optional bonus for students but a required skill for the 21st century STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) workforce; therefore, all physical and life science students should learn to program in the undergraduate curriculum.",,

Cluster analytical approaches consistently extracted four head-surface brain electric field configurations that optimally explain the variance of their changes across time in spontaneous EEG recordings. These four configurations are referred to as EEG microstate classes A, B, C, and D and have been associated with verbal/phonological, visual, subjective interoceptive–autonomic processing, and attention reorientation, respectively. The present study tested these associations via an intra-individual and inter-individual analysis approach. The intra-individual approach tested the effect of task-induced increased modality-specific processing on EEG microstate parameters. The inter-individual approach tested the effect of personal modality-specific parameters on EEG microstate parameters. We obtained multichannel EEG from 61 healthy, right-handed, male students during four eyes-closed conditions: object-visualization, spatial-visualization, verbalization (6 runs each), and resting (7 runs). After each run, we assessed participants' degrees of object-visual, spatial-visual, and verbal thinking using subjective reports. Before and after the recording, we assessed modality-specific cognitive abilities and styles using nine cognitive tests and two questionnaires. The EEG of all participants, conditions, and runs was clustered into four classes of EEG microstates (A, B, C, and D). RMANOVAs, ANOVAs and post-hoc paired t-tests compared microstate parameters between conditions. TANOVAs compared microstate class topographies between conditions. Differences were localized using eLORETA. Pearson correlations assessed interrelationships between personal modality-specific parameters and EEG microstate parameters during no-task resting. As hypothesized, verbal as opposed to visual conditions consistently affected the duration, occurrence, and coverage of microstate classes A and B. Contrary to associations suggested by previous reports, parameters were increased for class A during visualization, and class B during verbalization. In line with previous reports, microstate D parameters were increased during no-task resting compared to the three internal, goal-directed tasks. Topographic differences between conditions included particular sub-regions of components of the metabolic default mode network. Modality-specific personal parameters did not consistently correlate with microstate parameters except verbal cognitive style which correlated negatively with microstate class A duration and positively with class C occurrence. This is the first study that aimed to induce EEG microstate class parameter changes based on their hypothesized functional significance. Beyond the associations of microstate classes A and B with visual and verbal processing, respectively, our results suggest that a finely-tuned interplay between all four EEG microstate classes is necessary for the continuous formation of visual and verbal thoughts. Our results point to the possibility that the EEG microstate classes may represent the head-surface measured activity of intra-cortical sources primarily exhibiting inhibitory functions. However, additional studies are needed to verify and elaborate on this hypothesis.",,"Cognitive style, eLORETA, Object, Spatial, Verbal, Visual"

The beginning of computational intelligence has revolutionized the diagnostic landscape, offering promising ways for early and accurate detection of these debilitating conditions. Machine learning algorithms, a subset of computational intelligence, have emerged as powerful tools for analyzing extensive datasets comprising genetic, imaging, and clinical information. Furthermore, computational intelligence facilitates the integration of multimodal data, integrating information from genetic profiles, brain imaging (MRI, PET scans), and clinical assessments. This consolidative approach enables a comprehensive understanding of disease progression and aids in the development of predictive models for early medical assessment and prediction of the outcome. Moreover, the utilization of computational intelligence in neuroimaging analysis has shown remarkable potential. Advanced image processing techniques coupled with machine learning algorithms enable the detection of structural and functional abnormalities in the brain, often serving as precursors to neurodegenerative disorders. This chapter explores the key role of computational intelligence in enhancing the diagnosis of neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer, Parkinson, etc. In conclusion, computational intelligence offers a transformative framework for advancing the diagnosis of neurodegenerative disorders. Embracing and refining these computational tools will undoubtedly overlay the way for more effective interventions and personalized medicine in the fight against these challenging conditions.",Academic Press,"Computational biology, neurodegenerative disorders, diagnosis, artificial intelligence"

Specifically, the model simulates students' cognition as they complete activities within a science classroom. This study also seeks to examine the effects, as evidenced in the ANN, of an intervention designed to develop increased levels of critical thinking related to science skills. This model is based on the identification of cognitive attributes and integration of two advanced measurement frameworks: cognitive diagnostics and Item Response Theory. Both frameworks examine student response patterns, providing initial inputs for the ANN portion of the model. Once initial task response patterns are identified, they are parameterized and presented to the ANN. The ANN within this study is the foundational component of a computational model based upon the interaction of multiple, connected, adaptive processing elements know as cognitive attributes. These cognitive attributes process student responses to cognitive tasks within science tasks. Using the Student Task and Cognition Model (STAC-M), the study authors simulated a cognitive training intervention using a randomized control trial design of 100,000 students. Results of the simulation suggest that it is possible to increase levels of student success using a targeted cognitive attribute approach and that computational modeling provides a means to test educational theory for future education research.

Radical connectionism claims that cognition never implicates an internal symbolic medium, not even when natural language plays a part in our thought processes. On the face of it, such a position renders the human capacity for abstract thought quite mysterious. However, we argue that connectionism is committed to an analog conception of neural computation, and that representation of the abstract is no more problematic for a system of analog vehicles than for a symbol system. Natural language is therefore not required as a representational medium for abstract thought. Since natural language is arguably not a representational medium at all, but a conventionally governed scheme of communicative signals, we suggest that the role of internalised (i.e. self-directed) language is best conceived in terms of the coordination and control of cognitive activities within the brain.",,"Analog, Computation, Connectionism, Representation, Resemblance, Thought"

However, recent findings suggest that there can also be a positive correlation between cognitive capacity and correct intuitive thinking. Here we present results from 2 studies that directly contrasted whether cognitive capacity is more predictive of having correct intuitions or successful deliberate correction of an incorrect intuition. We used a two-response paradigm in which people were required to give a fast intuitive response under time pressure and cognitive load and afterwards were given the time to deliberate. We used a direction-of change analysis to check whether correct responses were generated intuitively or whether they resulted from deliberate correction (i.e., an initial incorrect-to-correct final response change). Results showed that although cognitive capacity was associated with the correction tendency (overall r = 0.22) it primarily predicted correct intuitive responding (overall r = 0.44). These findings force us to rethink the nature of sound reasoning and the role of cognitive capacity in reasoning.

Survey based stated preference methods, such as discrete choice experiments (DCEs), are used to elicit preferences for non-market goods. A critique of stated preference research is that respondents to hypothetical surveys may not provide careful and thoughtful responses that reveal rational preferences. Choice certainty has been used to measure survey respondents' task engagement. Researchers assume that respondents who are certain about their choices provide deliberative responses. In the case of DCE, we argue that the variability of choice certainty is also important. We present a novel framework to identify thoughtful / deliberative respondents. The framework combines respondents’ certainty with their variability in certainty across a set of choice tasks. We test our framework empirically using data from two case studies. We find respondents with higher mean certainty and variability (i) seldom use decision heuristics, (ii) are more likely to have monotonic preferences, (iii) have longer response times, (iv) make choices that have higher interval validity, and (v) have higher choice consistency. We discuss the relevance of alternative ex-post calibration strategies with a view to improve the precision and accuracy of DCE-based welfare estimates.",,"Choice certainty, Discrete choice experiments, Hypothetical bias, Information processing, Stated preferences, Survey engagement"

The threshold hypothesis (TH) is currently the dominant explanation for the relation between RR and DT, and posits that RR fundamentally supports DT, but only up to a point. In this study, quantile regression was used to test the TH among RR and two separate dimensions of DT: originality and fluency. Results generally supported the TH in regards to originality, with RR being significantly positively related to originality, but only in students at or below the median of the originality distribution. However, the TH was not upheld for fluency, which was only significantly predicted by RR at the top (i.e. 9th decile) of the fluency distribution. In general, results suggest that direct instructional intervention of RR strategies may be most supportive of creativity for those students who are simultaneously highly fluent but low-original thinkers.",,

Key questions about counterfactual thinking center on why and how they occur and what downstream cognitive and behavioral outcomes they engender. The functional theory of counterfactual thinking aims to answer these and other questions by drawing connections to goal cognition and by specifying distinct functions that counterfactuals may serve, including preparing for goal pursuit and regulating affect. Since the publication of our last theoretical statement (Epstude & Roese, 2008), numerous lines of empirical evidence support, or are rendered more readily understandable, when glimpsed through the lens of the functional theory. However, other lines of evidence have called into question the very basis of the theory. We integrate a broad range of findings spanning several psychological disciplines so as to present an updated version of the functional theory. We integrate findings from social psychology, cognitive neuroscience, developmental psychology, clinical psychology, and health psychology that support the claim that episodic counterfactual thoughts are geared mainly toward preparation and goal striving and are generally beneficial for individuals. Counterfactuals may influence behavior via either a content-specific pathway (in which the counterfactual insight informs behavior change) or a content-neutral pathway (in which the negative affect from the counterfactual motivates generic behavior change). Challenges to the functional theory of counterfactual thinking center on whether counterfactuals typically cohere to a structural form amenable to goal striving and whether behavioral consequences are mainly dysfunctional rather than functional. Integrating both supporting and challenging evidence, we offer a new theoretical synthesis intended to clarify the literature and guide future research in multiple disciplines of psychology.",Academic Press,"Counterfactual, Regret, Mental simulation, Goal, Regulatory, Episodic, Self-regulation, Affect, Emotion, Attribution, Orbitofrontal, Nucleus accumbens, Insula, Functional theory, Mental models"

This idea explains both rational and irrational motivations. In this paper, we revisit visual comprehension tasks based on this idea. At the theoretical level, we focus on the relationship between intuitive thinking, prior knowledge, and environmental information, and build a causal graph between the three. Further, inspired by the constructed causal graph, an intuitive optimization strategy with clear interpretability is proposed.

More recently, Generalized Invariance Structure Theory (GIST; Vigo, 2013, 2015; Vigo et al., 2022) has extended this methodological trajectory with respect to the study and formal modeling of human cognition. Indeed, GIST is the first systematic and extensively tested mathematical and computational theory of concept learning and categorization behavior (i.e., human generalization) based on such principles. The theory introduces an original mathematical and computational framework, with novel, more appropriate, and more natural characterizations, constructs, and measures of invariance and symmetry with respect to cognition than existing ones in the mathematical sciences and physics. These have proven effective in predicting and explaining empirically tested behavior in the domains of perception, concept learning, categorization, similarity assessment, aesthetic judgments, and decision making, among others. GIST has its roots in a precursor theory known as Categorical Invariance Theory (CIT; Vigo, 2009). This paper gives a basic introduction to two different notions of human invariance detection proposed by GIST and its precursor CIT: namely, a notion based on a cognitive mechanism of dimensional suppression, rapid attention shifting, and partial similarity assessment referred to as binding (s-invariance) and a perturbation notion based on perturbations of the values of the dimensions on which categories of object stimuli are defined (p-invariance). This is followed by the first simple formal proof of the invariance equivalence principle from GIST which asserts that the two notions are equivalent under a set of strict conditions on categories. The paper ends with a brief discussion of how GIST, unlike CIT, may be used to model probabilistic process accounts of categorization, and how it naturally and directly applies to the learning of sequential categories and to multiset-based concept learning.",,"Cognitive modeling, Invariance detection, Abstract symmetry, Categorical invariance, Invariance Equivalence Principle, Generalized Invariance Structure Theory, Structural Manifold, Logical Manifold"

This paper reports our experiences of, and learning from, creating systems thinking, analysis and modelling tools for use by policy actors, and of forging university-policy partnerships to drive transformative action towards health and wellbeing. Methods The Systems Science in Public Health and Health Economics Research (SIPHER) works through co-production partnerships with local (Sheffield City Council), regional (Greater Manchester Combined Authority) and national (Scottish Government; Public Health Scotland) policy organisations. We designed, deployed, and triangulated between, different methods to gain an in-depth understanding of the respective policy systems, including: policy and stakeholder analysis, interviews; participatory systems mapping workshops; evidence gap mapping; dynamic spatial microsimulation and system dynamic modelling; elicitation of public preferences across different wellbeing economy outcomes; a decision support infrastructure; and community panels to shape and scrutinise our work. Findings Our focus was on exploring the public health and equity impacts of housing, income, work and community wealth building policies, including in response to pandemic, cost-of-living crisis and fuel poverty. Qualitative systems methods were particularly useful in articulating the multiple goals and priorities of a policy system around a shared, cohesive wellbeing narrative. Computational modelling and decision tools provided insights into targeting options, visualising trade-offs between different policy priorities (eg, overall health gains, equity gains or policy cost). Interpretation Co-produced qualitative analyses, data, computational models, and decision tools aided deeper exploration of systemic effects, including feedback processes and co-benefits/trade-offs that link such policies to future health and wellbeing. The process of applying diverse systems methods also led to a broadening of researcher perspectives, shifting ways-of-doing and facilitating both cross-disciplinary and cross-sector discussion and collaboration.

These investigations have yielded key insights but are not well positioned to reveal the dynamic forces underlying symptom formation itself. Understanding symptom development over time would allow us to identify steps in the pathophysiological process leading to psychosis, shifting the focus of psychiatric intervention from symptom alleviation to prevention. We propose a model for understanding the emergence of psychotic symptoms within the context of an adaptive, developing neural system. We make the case for a pathophysiological process that begins with cortical hyperexcitability and bottom-up noise transmission, which engenders inappropriate belief formation via aberrant prediction error signaling. We argue that this bottom-up noise drives learning about the (im)precision of new incoming sensory information because of diminished signal-to-noise ratio, causing a compensatory relative overreliance on prior beliefs. This overreliance on priors predisposes to hallucinations and covaries with hallucination severity. An overreliance on priors may also lead to increased conviction in the beliefs generated by bottom-up noise and drive movement toward conversion to psychosis. We identify predictions of our model at each stage, examine evidence to support or refute those predictions, and propose experiments that could falsify or help select between alternative elements of the overall model. Nesting computational abnormalities within longitudinal development allows us to account for hidden dynamics among the mechanisms driving symptom formation and to view established symptoms as a point of equilibrium among competing biological forces.",,"Computational psychiatry, Hallucinations, Nosology, Perception, Psychosis"

In this framework, aggregation, preference, and the logical operators are described by the same unary generator function. Similarly to the implication being defined as a composition of the disjunction and the negation operator, preference operators were introduced as a composition of the aggregative operator and the negation operator.

In addition, the article synthesizes findings about teachers’ views in relation to the use of coding toys in ECEC and describes the outputs that the existing literature identifies as children’s development after play activities with coding toys. The systematic literature search was performed in accordance with the PRISMA-2020 statement, and the initial search across four databases (Eric, Scopus, Web of Science, and Academic Research Ultimate) for papers published between January 2010 and May 2022 yielded 2672 peer-reviewed articles. Following the first evaluation, the application of the inclusion and exclusion criteria resulted in a shortlist of 22 papers. The results show different strategies that the teachers can use during play activities with coding toys, assuming the roles of facilitators and mediators through collaborative work, allowing children to try and fail. Moreover, the results revealed that ECEC teachers largely hold positive and constructive attitudes towards the use of coding toys. Findings also highlight positive outcomes regarding children’s development across various cognitive and socio-emotional skills such as problem solving, computational thinking and communication.

In online tutoring, synchrony fosters better comprehension and engagement. Despite numerous methods to measure synchrony—such as lexical, syntactic, and semantic alignment—systematic comparisons across these approaches remain limited, impeding a full understanding of how synchrony operates across different educational contexts. This study addresses this gap by analyzing tutoring conversations from diverse contexts, particularly English as a Second Language (ESL) tutoring and algebra instruction, using seven computational models. These models yielded 29 synchrony indices, ranging from traditional lexical overlap to advanced natural language processing-based embedding models, capturing synchrony across multiple dimensions. Our results show that while these methods generally align with theoretical dimensions of synchrony, variations in embedding methods and distance measures can significantly impact their ability to capture meaningful interactions. Additionally, different subject domains influenced the finer-grained dimensions of synchrony observed, particularly in temporal aspects.",,"Linguistic synchrony, Computer-mediated tutoring conversation, Natural language processing, Computational linguistics"

For the engineering methodology, the current book emphasizes the combination between reductionism and holism theory, between analysis and integration, and between virtuality and substantiality. The new generation of the steel manufacturing process is proposed based on the thinking mode above. The thinking mode above clarifies that thinking and studying a new generation of the steel manufacturing process should neither consider things as its standard nor tend to the specific application of individual technology. The general theoretical study of integrity, openness, hierarchy, dynamic character in the steel manufacturing process is more important. The old method of figurative observation should be turned to the physical nature investigation of dynamic running process. Based on the rational abstract, concept research, top level design, the dynamic tailored design study and dynamic operation rules, etc., are performed.

Using loopholes is commonplace and intuitive in everyday social interaction, both familiar and consequential. Loopholes are also of concern in the law, and increasingly in artificial intelligence. However, the computational and cognitive underpinnings of loopholes are not well understood. Here, we propose a utility-theoretic recursive social reasoning model that formalizes and accounts for loophole behavior. The model captures the decision process of a loophole-aware listener, who trades off their own utility with that of the speaker, and considers an expected social penalty for non-cooperative behavior. The social penalty is computed through the listener’s recursive reasoning about a virtual naive observer’s inference of a naive listener’s social intent. Our model captures qualitative patterns in previous data, and also generates new quantitative predictions consistent with novel studies (N = 265). We consider the broader implications of our model for other aspects of social reasoning, including plausible deniability and humor.",,"Communication, Social cognition, Utility, Bayesian model"

Only the absolute price difference between the stores should be relevant in this case, but several experiments showed that people exhibit “relative thinking”: they are affected also by the relative savings (relative to the good’s price). This article analyzes the effects of this bias on firm strategy and market outcomes using a two-period game-theoretic model of location differentiation. Relative thinking causes consumers to make less effort to save a constant amount when they buy more expensive goods. In the location differentiation context this behavior can be modeled by consumers who behave as if their transportation costs are an increasing function of the good’s price. This gives firms an additional incentive to raise prices, in order to increase the perceived transportation costs of consumers, which consequently softens competition and allows higher profits. Therefore, the response of firms to relative thinking raises prices and profits and reduces consumer surplus, in both periods. Total welfare is unchanged in the first period, and in the second period it is either unchanged or reduced, depending on whether the objective or subjective transportation costs are used to compute welfare. The main results of the model (firms’ response to relative thinking increases prices and reduces consumer surplus) are likely to hold also in the context of search. The article also explains why “relative thinking” is a more appropriate term than “mental accounting” (which was often used before) to describe this behavior, and discusses why people might exhibit relative thinking.",,"Consumer psychology, Consumer attitudes and behavior, Marketing and advertising, Cognitive processes"

This work presents new climate performance indicators to evaluate business models (BM) based on life cycle assessment (LCA) and benchmarked with statistics for Sustainable Development Goal indicator 9.4.1. The research was conducted by action case studies involving 20 small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) from various sectors. The SMEs did not have previous experience with LCA. Therefore, a work process called “LCA á la carte” was designed to gradually increase details and effort. The results of simplified indicators on the manufacturing SMEs showed that the direct emissions to value added are lower than industry average. However, when upstream emissions and value added were included, the emission intensities are about industry average. The full life cycle climate indicators are presented for a boat production company that experiment with new BMs. Use phase electrification was found to be the most effective measure (60 % lower emission intensity), while material recycling and boat rental each reduced the emission intensity with about 30 %. However, a combination of these new BMs gives best results and could be needed to reach future benchmarks. This study suggests LCA for BM as a combination of a work process, actors' perspectives, and performance indicators.

Hence, future research could focus on developing more practical RO tools for application to the energy industry, thus making the utilization of powerful “real options thinking” for decision making under uncertainty more widespread. This is particularly important for applications in low carbon power and energy systems with increasing renewable and sustainable energy resources, given the different types of uncertainty they are facing in the transition towards a truly Smart Grid. In order to do so, and based on an extensive relevant literature review, the analogies with financial options are first presented, with various assumptions and their validity being clearly discussed in order to understand if, when, and how specific methods can be applied. It is then argued how option theory is in most cases not directly applicable to investment in energy systems but requires the consideration of their physical characteristics. The paper finally gives recommendations for building practical RO approaches to energy system (and potentially all engineering) project investments under uncertainty, regardless of the scale, time frame, or type of uncertainty involved.",,"Real Options, Flexibility, Renewable energy, Energy systems investment, Low carbon technologies, Smart Grid"

Nexus Informatics develops the science of recognising and quantifying nexus interlinkages. Nexus-coherent solutions enhance the effect of policymaking in achieving adequate governance, leading to successful strategic vision and efficient resource management. In this article, we present the structure of a System Dynamics Model—the Nexus_SDM—that maps sector-specific data from major databases (e.g., EUROSTAT) and scenario models (e.g., E3ME-FTT OSeMOSYS and SWIM) for the national case study of Greece. Disaggregation algorithms are employed on annual national-scale data, turning them into detailed spatial and temporal datasets, by converting them to monthly values spread among all 14 River Basin Districts (RBDs). The Nexus_SDM calculates Nexus Interlinkage Factors and quantifies interlinkages among Water, Energy, Food, Built Environment, Natural Land and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. It simulates the nexus in the national case study of Greece as a holistic multi-sectoral system and provides insights into the vulnerability of resources to future socio-economic scenarios. It calculates the link between crop type/area, irrigation water and agricultural value, revealing which crops have the highest agricultural value with the least water and crop area. It demonstrates that fossil fuel power generation and use of oil for transportation are responsible for the most GHG emissions in most RBDs and presents projections for years 2030 and 2050. The analysis showcases that to move from a general nexus thinking to an operational nexus concept, it is important to focus on data availability and scale.

Whole-brain analyses revealed a significant interaction between verbal CMDT and sex on (a) regional homogeneity within an area from the left anterior temporal lobe (b) on the resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) between the mPFC and the left inferior frontal gyrus and (c) on fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (fALFF) in several distinct areas, including the precuneus and middle cingulate gyrus, left middle temporal gyrus, right middle frontal gyrus, and cerebellum.

The present moment, in fact, is a transition from the concept of computer science as an artificial science to the understanding that information processes are abundant in nature. Computing is recognized as a natural science that studies natural and artificial information processes. In everyday computing, operations are performed on the individual generators, with little attention paid to their internal structure. However, many common operations consist of more primitive constructions connected by a combination mode. The interaction of information processes and corresponding structures is carried out in an environment of “applicative interaction”, their applications to each other, and the study of the properties of this environment allows us to understand the nature of the computations. In the present work, the main attention is paid to elucidating the technological features of computations with individual generators, or objects. Their interaction is considered in an applicative environment, which allows us to elucidate the internal structure of ordinary operations, the knowledge of which allows us to understand their properties. The choice of initial constant generators, considered as generic ones and expressed by combinators, is discussed. These initial generators are used as the main “building blocks” that occur within the larger blocks of the applicative environment in interaction with each other.

This perspective summarizes the key findings in the development of ordered mesoporous silica (OMS) and BIS synthesis, highlighting in particular the challenges faced in the development of scalable processing routes for these materials. Recent successes in improving mechanistic understanding of these syntheses using computational modelling are then presented, followed by suggestions as to how modelling may be used for predictive design of BIS with desired quality attributes.

The bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathway is essential for controlling the patterning and morphogenesis of the eggshell. During oogenesis, the roles of patterning and morphogenesis by the BMP type I receptor thickveins (tkv) have been studied extensively. However, signaling through this pathway requires both type I and II receptors, and the latter has yet to be established in oogenesis. We focus on wishful thinking (wit), the Drosophila homolog to the mammalian BMP type II receptor, BMPRII. We found that wit is expressed dynamically in the FCs of D. melanogaster in an evolutionary conserved pattern. The expression patterns are highly correlated with the dynamics of the BMP signaling, which is consistent with our finding that wit is a target of BMP signaling. Furthermore, we established that WIT is necessary for BMP signaling, and loss of WIT is associated with cell autonomous loss of BMP responses. Of importance, we demonstrated that perturbations in WIT led to changes in eggshell morphologies in domains that are patterned by BMP signaling. Previous studies have shown a role for WIT in BMP signaling during neurogenesis; however, our results reveal a role for WIT in epithelial cells' development.",,"Tissue patterning, Oogenesis, TGF-beta signaling"

By working with blind individuals, we can ask both what kinds of representations people form about others’ minds, and how much these representations depend on the observer having had similar mental states themselves. Thinking about others’ mental states depends on a specific group of brain regions, including the right temporo-parietal junction (RTPJ). We investigated the representations of others’ mental states in these brain regions, using multivoxel pattern analyses (MVPA). We found that, first, in the RTPJ of sighted adults, the pattern of neural response distinguished the source of the mental state (did the protagonist see or hear something?) but not the valence (did the protagonist feel good or bad?). Second, these neural representations were preserved in congenitally blind adults. These results suggest that the temporo-parietal junction contains explicit, abstract representations of features of others’ mental states, including the perceptual source. The persistence of these representations in congenitally blind adults, who have no first-person experience with sight, provides evidence that these representations emerge even in the absence of relevant first-person perceptual experiences.",,"Blindness, Theory of mind, Experience, Representation, fMRI, Multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA)"

These tests assessed both CAR and within-domain analogical reasoning (WAR) abilities using verbal analogy tasks in the A:B::C:D format and measured individual creativity levels using the Alternative Uses Test (AUT). We employed a connectome-based predictive modeling (CPM) approach, utilizing the Power264 brain atlas to identify functional connectomes supporting CAR abilities.

Functional anatomy and lesion analysis revealed that functional connectivity was broadly distributed across the brain. However, the default mode network, along with specific internetwork connections—such as between the salience and sensory/somatomotor mouth networks, and between the fronto-parietal task control and cingulo-opercular task control networks—showed preferential involvement.

Specifically, the ability to simultaneously evolve the state of an entire quantum system leads to quantum parallelism and interference. Despite these prospects, opportunities to bring quantum computing to bear on problems of computational mechanics remain largely unexplored. In this work, we demonstrate how quantum computing can indeed be used to solve representative volume element (RVE) problems in computational homogenisation with polylogarithmic complexity of O((logN)c), compared to O(Nc) in classical computing. Thus, our quantum RVE solver attains exponential acceleration with respect to classical solvers, bringing concurrent multiscale computing closer to practicality. The proposed quantum RVE solver combines conventional algorithms such as a fixed-point iteration for a homogeneous reference material and the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). However, the quantum computing reformulation of these algorithms requires a fundamental paradigm shift and a complete rethinking and overhaul of the classical implementation. We employ or develop several techniques, including the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT), quantum encoding of polynomials, classical piecewise Chebyshev approximation of functions and an auxiliary algorithm for implementing the fixed-point iteration and show that, indeed, an efficient implementation of RVE solvers on quantum computers is possible.

We take an example of a real-life blood bank which is struggling with the problems of high shortage and wastage of blood products, large inventory levels, poor and erratic blood collection, limited product variety, high error rate, high turnover of technicians, high operating expenses and low revenue levels. We show using the TOC approach how these seemingly unrelated problems faced by the bank are in fact highly inter-related and how they all originate from a single root-cause. A current reality tree (CRT) is used to identify the root cause responsible for all the major blood bank problems. A conflict resolution diagram (CRD) is constructed to identify the core-conflict(s) responsible for the blood bank's poor performance. A simple yet powerful solution is generated for the given bank by breaking the core-conflict resulting from a paradigm constraint in blood banking. A future reality tree (FRT) is then constructed to show how the TOC approach will help the blood bank in lowering its shortage and wastage levels in spite of collecting lesser number of units in blood donation camps. The bank will be able to significantly cut down its inventories and can issue fresher units to the patients. Blood bank's revenue levels will increase while its operating expense will decrease due to the TOC approach. The error rate as well as the turnover of technicians in the blood bank laboratory will also reduce considerably. A simulation model shows that the proposed TOC solution will reduce the annual shortage of red blood cells by 66% and platelets by 82% at the bank. Similarly, the wastage of red blood cells will decrease by 93%, plasma by 99% and platelets by 98%. The average inventory level of the red blood cells will drop by 41%, plasma by 95% and platelets by 10%. The major contribution of this research is to show that TP tools can be extremely powerful in constructing win-win solutions for complex systems like blood banks by addressing their major problems in an integrated fashion. The TOC approach reveals how one widely-held belief in the blood banking world is the main reason behind the blood banks' poor state of affairs. The solutions presented in this research should be readily applicable to other blood banks which are struggling to improve their operational and financial performance.",,"Inventory management, Blood banks, Theory of Constraints (TOC), Thinking Process"

However, by 2023, the original authors concede the test has been soundly defeated by large language models which still seem to lack common sense of full-bodied thinking. In this paper, we argue that disambiguating sentences only seemed like a good test of common-sense based on a certain picture of the relationship between linguistic comprehension and semantic knowledge—one typically associated with the early computational theory of mind and Symbolic AI. If this picture is rejected, as it is by most LLM researchers, then disambiguation ceases to look like a comprehensive test of common-sense and instead appear only to test linguistic competence.

Also, the importance of energy-efficient information technology for environmentally conscious and feasible information technology is a hot topic because a computer faces environmental challenges at every stage of its life, from development to use to disposal. Due to changing environmental conditions, corporations have prioritized carbon emissions in procurement and transportation, which have the highest carbon impact. To encourage potential suppliers to adopt environmentally friendly practices, green criteria should be introduced into public procurement. Environmentally friendly corporate practices and environmental conservation are considered significant tools through public procurement. Techniques for green procurement and production procedures have recently been correlated with the concept of computational techniques of green procurement and production, owing to the increased emphasis on the concept of computational approaches.

We are not satisfied by what mainstream legal scholarship has on offer in this context. Positivists consider the issue outside their domain. Realists (including their critical branch) focus on the behavior of legal institutions, ignoring many of the diverse institutions that have regulatory force. We need an additional, complementary perspective to help us, legal scholars, earn and hold serious positions in the diverse disciplinary teams that we need to participate in, in order to adequately investigate (and inform on) persistent problems concerning personal-data protection as faced by legislators. In this article we investigate whether the subject matter of data protection law, identified as Personal Data Community (hereinafter PDC), can be treated as a complex adaptive system (hereinafter CAS). This proposition is premised on the argument that the PDC exhibits key traits of CAS, including systemic, dynamic and complex characteristics. And we further show how complexity theory can help legal scholarship (without losing its identity) to join and add value to diverse disciplinary research and advisory teams. In this article, we aim for a stepping-stone (establishing that data protection law addresses a complex adaptive system with all of its corollaries), rather than for final solutions.",,"Data protection law, Complex adaptive system, Dynamics of innovation, Self-organization, Emergence"

However, courses that can guide students through the practical applications of AI technology are still scarce in K-12 education. This study aimed to develop a project-based machine learning (ML) course for the implementation of AI technology. The core idea of this course, which focused on the supervised learning of AI ML technology, was designed based on the project of weather prediction. Furthermore, data collection and status display were realized using various hardware devices such as Arduino and sensors, whereas ML algorithms were implemented in Python programming language. A total of 68 eleventh-grade senior high school students from a public school in Southern Taiwan participated in this study. The main variables included understanding AI concepts, computational thinking (CT), and learning attitude. Data were analyzed using quantitative statistics, including descriptive statistics, t-test, and analysis of covariance, supplemented with qualitative data. Based on the findings, the following conclusions were drawn: (1) the proposed course on the implementation of ML helps students understand the basic concepts of AI; (2) students demonstrate a significant improvement in CT skills after attending this course; (3) although the students’ attitude toward learning AI shows no significant change after attending this course, their overall view for it is positive; (4) contrary to their learning attitude, the CT skills among the students with different capabilities of learning AI are significantly dissimilar. Overall, the machine-learning implementation course developed in this study can serve as a reference for promoting AI education in the future. However, considering learners’ prior knowledge in programming, setting up appropriate learning scaffolding for them, and providing them with more examples of the applications of AI in real-life scenarios is still necessary when conducting the course for improving the students’ attitude toward AI.",,"Artificial intelligence, Machine learning, Computational thinking, Secondary education"

Heuristic and analytic processing in reasoning. British Journal of Psychology, 75, 451–468], for example, claim that the monitoring of the heuristic system is typically quite lax whereas others such as Sloman [Sloman, S. A. (1996).

The present study contrasted these views. Participants solved classic base rate neglect problems while thinking aloud. In these problems a stereotypical description cues a response that conflicts with the response based on the analytic base rate information. Verbal protocols showed no direct evidence for an explicitly experienced conflict. As Kahneman and Evans predicted, participants hardly ever mentioned the base rates and seemed to base their judgment exclusively on heuristic reasoning. However, more implicit measures of conflict detection such as participants’ retrieval of the base rate information in an unannounced recall test, decision making latencies, and the tendency to review the base rates indicated that the base rates had been thoroughly processed. On control problems where base rates and description did not conflict this was not the case. Results suggest that whereas the popular characterization of conflict detection as an actively experienced struggle can be questioned there is nevertheless evidence for Sloman’s and Epstein’s basic claim about the flawless operation of the monitoring. Whenever the base rates and description disagree people will detect this conflict and consequently redirect attention towards a deeper processing of the base rates.

Specifically, we attend to the ways in which children can be centered at the computational science exhibit (moments in which their goals, histories, and desires are driving the exhibit’s interaction) by the actions of parents and museum facilitators or be decentered by them. Through qualitative analysis of video-recorded interactions of adults and children at the exhibit, we present categories of centering or decentering interactions while preserving the nuance and ambiguity involved in sociocultural contexts of learning.

According to the theoretical framework of mechanical rationalism, we study how the development of machine intelligence is a continuation, through different means, of the old process of outsourcing of cognitive activities by humans onto parts of their physical environments. Because of this process, an increasingly larger portion of the non-human environment performs perceptive and cognitive activities. From this follows that machine systems, not necessarily humans anymore, are the components of the physical environment that perform measurements on the universe of which the humans are also components. We suggest that the scientific discussion on the topic of AI development could be framed in the context of a more general phenomenon of an increase in the computational and perceptual capabilities of the physical universe, as opposed to a merely human and technological problem. This is because, ever so slightly, humans are being removed from the cognitive processes of technological systems they created, which continue to perceive and think autonomously. The act of machine cognition, or rather, of machine measurements, causes an effect on the environment in which humans live, and ever more so than the human measurements. Finally, we discuss the current approach to the development of viable AI systems that aim at increasing the reciprocal intelligence of humans and machines, rather than the replacement of the former's cognitive faculties by the latter.",,"Machine intelligence, Computational universe, Bohmian mechanics, History of AI, Mechanical rationalism"

Several uncertainties raised in multivariant complexity for mathematical-based computational reasoning cannot be converted in machine language, which can be understood by computer.

The uncertainty fuzziness issues could be solved through computational artificial intelligence–based neural networks, which understand the real world as well as experimental facts through biological and evolutionary computing and machine learning with probabilistic methods.

Exergy is defined by literature as the amount of useful work that can be derived from a real system when it is brought into equilibrium with its environment. In the literature, it is considered an outstanding concept that can be applied to enhance the effectiveness of ordinary evaluation models such as LCA. The literature proposes a variety of hybrid approaches that combine Exergetic Analysis (EA) and LCA with different combination frameworks. The aim of this paper is to describe the potential of each hybrid method and to characterize the degree of interoperability between EA and LCA that each of them can provide. Nevertheless, there are drawbacks that seem to be too challenging to overcome: a variety of inconsistencies in the interpretation of the results due to the difficulty of the inventory phase and the ambiguity in the choice of the correct alternative in the standard databases; the link with old techniques that refers to obsolete approaches in finding data that suit to the updated goals and scopes; the difficulty in conducting an assessment affected by the least possible uncertainty. Following a theoretical overview of the principles of each hybrid method that binds EA and LCA, the authors want to provide a review from a completely different point of view than the state-of-the-art literature, on how effectively EA and LCA can interact with each other in order to provide a more holistic view of the system/process to be assessed. The fascinating circumstance that emerges from the review is that any exergy approach would be more effective if joined (not replaced) to the standard LCA, because it turned out to be complementary. This theory has long been developed by many authors in their case studies as a confirmation of what Gutowski wrote years ago: no single alternative criteria or subsidiary model, independently of how well aggregated, may offer a suitable answer for all conditions. Specifically, through this review, the practitioners would be able to choose the best suited hybrid methodology, according to their aims, join the outcomes together and achieve a transdisciplinary knowledge of the behavior of the study case system, in order to design the best improvement strategies.",,"Exergy, Hybrid methods, Integration modelling, Life cycle assessment, Process reversibility, Sustainable manufacturing"

Even for complete loss-of-function variants causing inherited, monogenic diseases, current understanding based on gene-specific molecular function does not adequately predict variability observed between people with identical mutations or fluctuating disease trajectories. We present a parallel paradigm for loss-of-function variants based on broader consequences to the cell when aberrant polypeptide chains of amino acids are translated from mutant RNA to generate mutated proteins. Missense variants that modify primary amino acid sequence, and nonsense/frameshift variants that generate premature termination codons (PTCs), are placed in context alongside emergent themes of chaperone binding, protein quality control capacity, and cellular adaptation to stress. Relatively stable proteostasis burdens are contrasted with rapid changes after induction of gene expression, or stress responses that suppress nonsense mediated decay (NMD) leading to higher PTC transcript levels where mutant proteins can augment cellular stress. For known disease-causal mutations, an adjunctive variant categorization system enhances clinical predictive power and precision therapeutic opportunities. Additionally, with typically more than 100 nonsense and frameshift variants, and ∼10,000 missense variants per human DNA, the paradigm focuses attention on all protein-coding DNA variants, and their potential contributions to multimorbid states beyond classically designated inherited diseases. Experimental testing in clinically relevant systems is encouraged to augment current atlases of protein expression at single-cell resolution, and high-throughput experimental data and deep-learning models that predict which amino acid substitutions generate enhanced degradative burdens. Incorporating additional dimensions such as pan-proteome competition for chaperones, and age-related loss of proteostasis capacity, should further accelerate health impacts.",,

In the meantime, the best we can do is distance ourselves from terracentric assumptions. There is no reason, for example, to assume that all inferential abilities are language-like. With that in mind, I argue that logical reasoning does not have to be couched in symbolic notation. In diagrammatic reasoning, inferences are underwritten, not by rules, but by transformations of self-same qualitative signs. I use the Existential Graphs of C. S. Peirce to show this.

Over the past fifteen years, CPT has been used in various scenarios, from promoting healthy diets to supporting chronic disease management. Despite the proliferation of intelligent systems and Web-based applications, the ethical and legal nuances of these technologies have become increasingly significant. The review follows a structured methodology, assessing 92 primary studies through sixteen research questions covering demographics, application scenarios, user requirements, objectives, functionalities, technologies, advantages, limitations, proposed solutions, ethical and legal implications, and the role of explainable AI (XAI). The findings indicate that while CPT holds promise in inducing behavioral change, many prototypes remain untested on a large scale (60% of surveyed studies only developed at a conceptual level), and long-term effectiveness is still uncertain (36% report attaining their goals, but none focuses on long-term assessment). The study highlights the need for more comparative analyses of persuasion models and tailored approaches to meet diverse user needs. Ethical and legal concerns, such as patient consent, data privacy, and potential for users’ manipulation, are under-explored and require deeper investigation. The paper recommends a bottom-up regulatory approach to create more effective and flexible ethical and legal guidelines for CPT applications. In conclusion, significant advancements have been made in CPT for eHealth, but ongoing research is essential to address current limitations, enhance user acceptability and adherence, and ensure ethical and legal soundness.",,"Computational persuasion, eHealth, Behavior change, Ethics, Legal implications, Systematic literature review"

Aberrant controllability computation might lead to maladaptive behaviors and poor mental health outcomes. Illusion of control, which refers to a heightened sense of control while the environment is uncontrollable, is one such manifestation and has been conceptually associated with delusional ideation. Nevertheless, this association has not yet been formally characterized in a computational framework. To address this, we used a computational psychiatry approach to quantify illusion of control in human participants with high (n = 125) or low (n = 126) trait delusion. Participants played a two-party exchange game in which their choices either did (“Controllable condition”) or did not (“Uncontrollable condition”) influence the future monetary offers made by simulated partners. We found that the two groups behaved similarly in model-agnostic measures (i.e., offer size, rejection rate). However, computational modeling revealed that compared to the low trait delusion group, the high delusion group overestimated their influence (“expected influence” parameter) over the offers made by their partners under the Uncontrollable condition. Highly delusional individuals also reported a stronger sense of control than those with low trait delusion in the Uncontrollable condition. Furthermore, the expected influence parameter and self-reported beliefs about controllability were significantly correlated in the Controllable condition in individuals with low trait delusion, whereas this relationship was diminished in those with high trait delusion. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that delusional ideation is associated with aberrant computation of and belief about environmental controllability, as well as a belief-behavior disconnect.",,"Delusion, Social controllability, Illusion of control, Beliefs, Schizophrenia, Computational psychiatry"

While frequently inferred that these parenting practices reflect different cultural logics of parenting, such logics are inherently hard to measure. Our paper proposes a new inductive way to study parenting logics using computational text analysis applied to a nationally representative survey where respondents provided parenting advice across three hypothetical parenting situations. Analyzing this advice using Biterm Topic Modeling we find that nearly all parenting logics reflect some form of intensive parenting, but within that are multiple nuanced versions varying across two dimensions: (1) assertive vs negotiated parenting, and (2) pedagogic vs pragmatic parenting. Using fractional multinomial logistic regression, we find little difference in how parenting logics vary by race/ethnicity, education, and income, suggesting more similarity across groups and more variability within groups than commonly understood. These findings also demonstrate how computational techniques may provide complementary tools to enrich the study of long-standing questions in social science research, at times offering an analytical naïveté that human coding cannot offer.",,"Family, Parenting, Socioeconomic status, Computational social science, Text as data, Topic modeling"

Namely, they facilitate information gain, allowing an organism to maintain accurate beliefs about the environment and select actions that better maximize reward. However, finding the optimal balance between exploration and reward-seeking behavior – the so-called explore-exploit dilemma – can be challenging, as it requires sensitivity to one’s own uncertainty and to the predictability of one’s surroundings. Given the close relationship between uncertainty and anxiety, a body of work has now also emerged identifying associated effects on exploration. In particular, the field of computational psychiatry has begun to use cognitive computational models to characterize how anxiety may modulate underlying information processing mechanisms, such as estimation of uncertainty and the value of information, and how this might contribute to psychopathology. Here, we review computational modeling studies investigating how exploration is influenced by anxiety. While some apparent inconsistencies remain to be resolved, studies using reinforcement learning tasks suggest that directed (but not random) forms of exploration may be elevated by trait and/or cognitive anxiety, but reduced by state and/or somatic anxiety. Anxiety is also consistently associated with less exploration in foraging tasks. Some differences in exploration may further stem from how anxiety modulates changes in uncertainty over time (learning rates). Jointly, these results highlight important directions for future work in refining choice of tasks and anxiety measures and maintaining consistent methodology across studies.",,"Directed exploration, Random exploration, Foraging, Anxiety, Information-seeking"

Although synthetic COX-2 inhibitors demonstrate therapeutic efficacy, their adverse effects necessitate alternative treatment approaches. Curcuma longa L., traditionally known for its anti-inflammatory properties, presents promising therapeutic potential, yet the molecular mechanisms of its active compounds remain incompletely characterized. This study aimed to elucidate the binding mechanisms, molecular interactions, and drug-like properties of Curcuma longa L. compounds against human COX-2 and compare their efficacy with that of the standard drug rofecoxib. We employed molecular docking using AutoDock Vina, assessed drug-likeness using Lipinski's Rule analysis, and conducted a comprehensive pharmacokinetic property evaluation. Isorhamnetin exhibited superior binding affinity (-9.8 kcal/mol), surpassing rofecoxib (-7.5 kcal/mol) by 30.7%. It formed crucial hydrogen bonds with Thr192, Val349, and Ser530 and hydrophobic interactions with Leu352 and Val523. Dihydrocostunolide (-9.2 kcal/mol) and beta-Vatirenene (-8.8 kcal/mol) exhibited predominantly hydrophobic interactions with Phe518 and Ala527. We discovered an inverse relationship between Lipinski's Rule compliance and binding strength, with rule violations showing enhanced affinities (single: -8.19 kcal/mol; double: -10.4 kcal/mol). Molecular size was negatively correlated with binding affinity (r = -0.66). Notably, 40.3 % of the compounds outperformed rofecoxib. Our findings identified promising natural COX-2 inhibitors of Curcuma longa L., with isorhamnetin showing particular potential through its unique interaction profile. This study challenges traditional drug design paradigms, suggesting that controlled deviation from drug-likeness rules may benefit COX-2 inhibitor development.

There are two modeling frameworks, reinforcement learning (RL) and drift diffusion modeling (DDM), that are well-developed in cognitive science, and have begun to be applied to Gambling Disorder. RL models focus on explaining how an agent uses reward to learn about the environment and make decisions based on outcomes. The DDM is a binary choice framework that breaks down decision making into psychologically meaningful components based on choice reaction time analyses. Both approaches have begun to yield insight into aspects of cognition that are important for, but not unique to, gambling, and thus relevant to the development of Gambling Disorder. However, these approaches also oversimplify or neglect various aspects of decision making seen in real-world gambling behavior. Gambling Disorder presents an opportunity for ‘bespoke’ modeling approaches to consider these neglected components. In this review, we discuss studies that have used RL and DDM frameworks to investigate some of the key cognitive components in gambling and Gambling Disorder.

We pursued the aim to elucidate its underlying cognitive mechanisms by analysing picture descriptions from 94 subjects (29 healthy controls, 18 participants at clinical high risk, 29 with first-episode psychosis, and 18 with chronic schizophrenia), using five language models with different computational architectures: FastText, which represents meaning non-contextually/statically; BERT, which represents contextual meaning sensitive to grammar and context; Infersent and SBERT, which provide sentential representations; and CLIP, which evaluates speech relative to a visual stimulus. These models were used to quantify semantic distances crossed between successive tokens/sentences, and semantic perplexity indicating unexpectedness in continuations. Results showed that, among patients, semantic similarity increased when measured with FastText, Infersent, and SBERT, while it decreased with CLIP and BERT. Higher perplexity was observed in first-episode psychosis. Static semantic measures were associated with clinically measured impoverishment of thought and referential semantic measures with disorganization. These patterns indicate a shrinking conceptual semantic space as represented by static language models, which co-occurs with a widening in the referential semantic space as represented by contextual models.

The players are rational in all possible worlds and know each other’s strategies in all possible worlds — which, together, we refer to as Perfect Prediction. The anticipation of a player’s decision by their opponents is counterfactually dependent on the decision, unlike in Nash Equilibria where the decisions are made independently. The equilibrium, when it exists, is unique and is Pareto optimal. This equilibrium is the normal-form counterpart of the Perfect Prediction Equilibrium; the prediction happens “in another room” rather than in the past. The equilibrium can also be seen as a natural extension of Hofstadter’s superrationality to non-symmetric games. Algorithmically, an iterated elimination of non-individually-rational strategy profiles is performed until at most one remains. An equilibrium is a strategy profile that is immune against knowledge of strategies in all possible worlds and rationality in all possible worlds, a stronger concept than common knowledge of rationality but also stronger than common counterfactual belief of rationality. We formalize and contrast the Non-Nashian Decision Theory paradigm, common to this and several other papers, with Causal Decision Theory and Evidential Decision Theory. We define the Perfectly Transparent Equilibrium algorithmically and prove (when it exists) that it is unique, that it is Pareto-optimal, and that it coincides with Hofstadter’s Superrationality on symmetric games. We relate the finding to concepts found in the literature such as Individual Rationality, Rationalizability, Minimax-Rationalizability, Second-Order Nash Equilibria, the Program Equilibrium, the Perfect Prediction Equilibrium, Shiffrin’s Joint-Selfish-Rational Equilibrium, the Stalnaker–Bonanno Equilibrium, the Perfect Cooperation Equilibrium, the Translucent Equilibrium, the Correlated Equilibrium, and Quantum Games.

Implementing such systems at building level can facilitate the development of net-zero energy buildings. Energy system planning is a multi-faceted problem that involves technical, economic, environmental, and social dimensions, and affects multiple stakeholders at different levels. A multi-objective optimisation approach is needed to identify the optimal energy choices at building level, while paying attention to stakeholder priorities and other constraints. The objective of this study is to develop a model to identify the optimal mix of renewable energy (RE) while also accounting for uncertainties, which can be integrated at building level with life cycle thinking. A framework was proposed for planning an optimised hybrid RE system at building level to support the net-zero development goals. The optimisation model was developed considering the objectives of minimising energy system cost, maximising operational cost savings, minimising the life cycle environmental impacts, and maximising the RE fraction. A combinatorial optimisation approach was adopted to reflect the practical engineering aspects of energy planning problems based on technologies available in the market. The developed framework was demonstrated through a case study conducted for an average multi-unit residential buildings (MURB) located in British Columbia, Canada. The results indicated that under the defined stakeholder priorities and constraints, ground source heat pumps and solar photovoltaics (PV) are the optimal energy choices for MURB, and the optimal energy system combination supplied 44% of the building's energy demand through RE.

Drawing from constructionist and critical pedagogical perspectives, our research questions are: (1) How do children develop machine learning knowledge grounded in social, ethical, and political orientations in a CML education program? and (2) What computational practices do children engage in when developing robots for social good in a CML education program? We found that (1) children made more sophisticated connections with socio-political orientations and ML content as they progressed through the program, and (2) they engaged in computational practices, such as experimenting and iterating, testing and debugging, reusing and remixing, and abstracting and modularizing. Further, our findings indicate that a critical lens to ML education can be characterized by posing and answering questions about the roles of AI technologies producers and consumers and identifying how these technologies are designed to apply this knowledge to build applications for marginalized populations.

One promising approach is the development of computational assays: integrating computational models with cognitive tasks to infer latent patient-specific disease processes in brain computations. While recent years have seen many methodological advancements in computational modelling and many cross-sectional patient studies, much less attention has been paid to basic psychometric properties (reliability and construct validity) of the computational measures provided by the assays. In this review, we assess the extent of this issue by examining emerging empirical evidence. We find that many computational measures suffer from poor psychometric properties, which poses a risk of invalidating previous findings and undermining ongoing research efforts using computational assays to study individual (and even group) differences.

However, in small-batch and highly customized assembly tasks, frequently changes in production procedures pose significant cognition challenges. To address this, leveraging computer vision technology to enhance human cognition becomes a feasible solution. Therefore, this review aims to explore the cognitive characteristics of human beings and classify existing computer vision technologies in a manner that discusses the future development of cognition-augmented human-centric assembly. The concept of cognition-augmented assembly is first proposed based on the brain's functional structure - the frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes. Corresponding to these brain regions, cognitive issues in spatiality, memory, knowledge, and decision-making are summarized. Recent studies conducted between 2014 and 2023 on visual computation of assembly are categorized into four groups: position registration, multi-layer recognition, contextual perception, and mixed-reality fusion, all aimed at addressing these cognitive challenges. The applications and limitations of current computer vision technology are discussed. Furthermore, considering the rapidly evolving technologies such as the metaverse, cloud services, large language models, and brain-computer interfaces, future trends on computer vision are prospected to augment human cognition corresponding to the cognitive issues.",,"Cognitive assistance, Human-centric assembly, Computer vision, Metaverse, Cloud service, Large language model, Brain computer interface"

While hyperconnectivity in the DMN, hypoconnectivity in the CEN, and abnormal SN connectivity have been observed in acutely depressed patients, evidence for network alterations during remission is limited. Further, there are few studies examining connectivity in people in remission from MDD (rMDD) during emotional processing tasks, including during affective cognition (i.e., tasks that encompass affective processing in the context of cognitive processes, such as inhibition). To address these literature gaps, this study compared functional connectivity (FC) between resting and task conditions, specifically during the emotional Stroop (eStroop) task, as well as between rMDD and healthy volunteers (HVs), within and between nodes of the three networks. We also explored how FC relates to rumination in the rMDD group, given that rumination tends to persist in rMDD and involves affective and cognitive networks. We unexpectedly found greater FC during the task vs. rest condition within the DMN, and decreased FC during the task vs. rest conditions within the CEN and SN across the groups. Greater FC during the task vs. rest condition between DMN and SN nodes, as well as between CEN and SN nodes were also observed. These effects were more pronounced in the rMDD group as per our exploratory analyses. Additionally, the rMDD vs. HV group showed higher FC between DMN-CEN nodes, regardless of condition. Higher hopeless rumination scores were associated with decreased resting FC within the DMN, while higher active problem-solving scores were associated with increased task FC within the DMN in the rMDD group. These findings suggest that tasks engaging affective cognition processes influence FC within and among the three networks, with this effect more pronounced in the rMDD group. This might indicate potential protective and compensatory mechanisms in rMDD and expands our understanding of large-scale intrinsic network connectivity alterations during remission from depression.

Yet, while studying we are also often engaged in internal secondary tasks such as planning, ruminating, or daydreaming. It remains unclear whether such a secondary internal task has similar effects on memory and what the neural mechanisms underlying such an influence are. We therefore measured participants' blood oxygenation level dependent responses while they learned word-pairs and simultaneously performed different types of secondary tasks (i.e., internal, external, and control). Memory performance decreased in both internal and external secondary tasks compared to the easy control condition. However, while the external task reduced activity in memory-encoding related regions (hippocampus), the internal task increased neural activity in brain regions associated with self-reflection (anterior medial prefrontal cortex), as well as in regions associated with performance monitoring and the perception of salience (anterior insula, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex). Resting-state functional connectivity analyses confirmed that anterior medial prefrontal cortex and anterior insula/dorsal anterior cingulate cortex are part of the default mode network and salience network, respectively. In sum, a secondary internal task impairs memory performance just as a secondary external task, but operates through different neural mechanisms.",,"Attention, Cognitive self-consciousness, Default mode network, Proactive interference/ memory, Salience network, fMRI"

Objective In this project, we investigated whether computational linguistic techniques can be applied to text-based communications with the goal of identifying a client’s mental health status. Methods Client-therapist text messages were analyzed using the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count tool. We examined whether the resulting word counts related to the participants’ presenting problems or their self-ratings of mental health at the completion of counseling. Results The results confirmed that word use patterns could be used to differentiate whether a client had one of the top 3 presenting problems (depression, anxiety, or stress) and, prospectively, to predict their self-rated mental health after counseling had been completed.

More recently, though, longer durations have also been linked to mind wandering, a perceptually decoupled state of attention marked by decreased visual-cognitive processing. Toward better understanding the relationship between fixation durations and visual-cognitive processing, we ran simulations using an established random-walk model for saccade timing and programming and assessed which model parameters best predicted modulations in fixation durations associated with mind wandering compared to attentive viewing. Mind wandering-related fixation durations were best described as an increase in the variability of the fixation-generating process, leading to more variable—sometimes very long—durations. In contrast, past research showed that increased processing demands increased the mean duration of the fixation-generating process. The findings thus illustrate that mind wandering and processing demands modulate fixation durations through different mechanisms in scene viewing. This suggests that processing demands cannot be inferred from changes in fixation durations without understanding the underlying mechanism by which these changes were generated.",,"Visual-cognitive processing, Mind wandering, Fixation duration, Computational modeling, Scene viewing"

Today agriculture is regarded as an integral part of interconnected value chains that sit at the heart of our economies, providing invaluable services to society. In response, most governments around the world are now actively developing policies to support and grow their bio-economies. This increases the expectations that society and governments have in terms of agriculture’s services and performance: agriculture is not only expected to generate food for our growing populations and income for farmers, it must be part of value chains that provide raw materials that can be incorporated or converted into feed, fiber, fuel, pharmaceuticals, and other industrial products. Farmers are expected to be responsible custodians of our landscapes and their farming practices must be economically, environmentally, and socially sustainable and aligned with the broader and changing values of our societies. Often these three objectives conflict and consequently societal expectations are not met. In a world that is increasingly data rich, practicing agriculture in a way that lives up to these expectations requires tools that can help to foresee the consequences of complex interactions. Hence, this chapter explores the role of modeling and systems thinking to manage this complexity by explicitly considering three attributes of complex, adaptive systems, whereby (i) order emerges rather than being predetermined; (ii) the system’s future can only be assessed probabilistically rather than deterministically predicted; and (iii) the history of the system is largely irreversible. The chapter reflects on the contemporary use of models against these three systems characteristics and concludes that scientifically based and tested algorithms (i.e., models) are already a ubiquitous and indispensable management tool for modern farming. Countless apps are already in use for short-term, tactical decision making, while more complex modeling approaches are vital for strategic scenario planning and risk assessments for farmers, policymakers, and scientists.",Academic Press,"Agriculture, Systems thinking, Complexity, Adaptation, Risk management, Modeling, Bioeconomy, Value chains, Social license, Industry 4.0, Sustainability"

At the same time it would like to represent an explicit “Tribute” to Prof. Odum, because the original concept is already seminally present in his well-known Rules of Emergy Algebra. This novelty in Mathematical Modelling is represented by the so-called “Emerging Solutions”, which are radically different from solutions to traditional mathematical problems. This is because any traditional solution to an algebraic or differential problem is always represented by a formal expression that, when reintroduced into the initial formulation of the problem, reduces the latter to a perfect identity. Emerging Solutions, on the contrary, show an Ordinal Information content which is always much higher than the corresponding content pertaining to the initial formulation of the problem. Emerging Solutions, in fact, originate from any physical problem when this is modelled in accordance with the Maximum Ordinality Principle, and thus understood in Ordinal Terms. Such a property, which represents one of the most interesting aspects of the Maximum Ordinality Principle, then suggests we adopt a Generative way of Thinking when designing a new practical application. The same happens at the level of Will, that is at the level of Decision Making. Clearly, if we really want to take advantage of those “Emerging Exits” which arise from the physical behaviour of the system. Finally, at the level of Acting, if we are really interested in favouring any “emerging behaviour” of the system which is decisively capable to improve our design. For instance, to get the maximum intrinsic stability of the system, so as to prevent any possible disturbance that might significantly alter its expected behaviour. All these aspects will be illustrated through the case of Smart Grids, with particular reference to their large scale “intrinsic” instability and their recognized strong vulnerability to “cyber” attacks.",,"Emerging Solutions, Incipient Differential Calculus (IDC), Maximum Ordinality Principle, Intractable problems, Smart Grids"

We provide a detailed case study of two students as they encoded outcomes in their work on several related counting problems within a computational setting. We highlight the role that a computational environment may have played in this encoding activity. We illustrate ways in which by-hand work and computer programming worked together to facilitate the students’ successful encoding activity.

Despite the existence of various techniques, many face challenges in achieving a balance between precision, robustness, computational efficiency, and execution time. In this paper, we present a novel hybrid algorithm, Differentiated Creative Search combined with Newton-Raphson (DCS-NR), designed to improve the accuracy and efficiency of PV parameter extraction. DCS employs a dual-strategy mechanism that balances exploration and exploitation through divergent and convergent thinking, ensuring a comprehensive search for solutions. The Newton-Raphson method further refines the parameters optimized by DCS, minimizing the discrepancy between estimated and measured currents, and consequently improving power estimation. The proposed approach is evaluated on three distinct models: Single Diode Model (SDM), Double Diode Model (DDM), and PV Module Model (PMM). Among the different models tested, DCS-NR consistently delivers superior accuracy. For example, it achieves an RMSE of 7.75392 × E−04 for the RTC France SDM and 1.77454 × E−04 for the PVM 752 cell, outperforming ten state-of-the-art metaheuristic algorithms. Moreover, DCS-NR demonstrates remarkable computational efficiency, requiring only 0.830 s on average for the RTC France SDM, which is considerably faster than algorithms such as Flying Foxes Optimization (251.5 s). Furthermore, it proves highly effective in real-world conditions, under varying irradiance and constant temperature, as well as vice versa. The method consistently converges within approximately 100 iterations, showcasing rapid optimization capabilities. These findings highlight the potential of DCS-NR as a powerful and versatile tool for photovoltaic parameter extraction, capable of addressing diverse and challenging scenarios.",,"Photovoltaic parameter extraction, Parameter identification, Hybrid optimization methods, Differentiated creative search (DCS), Newton-Raphson (NR) method, Metaheuristic algorithms"

Successful pair programming interventions necessitate mutual engagement between partners within a dyad. However, the measurement of mutual engagement in dyadic collaborative learning remains an under-researched area. This research represents a foundational stage in bridging this gap by developing a comprehensive 20-item Pair-Programming Mutual Engagement Questionnaire (PPME-Q) as a measure of mutual engagement in pair programming at the activity level. The questionnaire was validated through a sample of 86 eighth-grade students. Confirmatory factor analysis confirmed the existence of a four-factor structure comprising of the behavioral, cognitive, emotional, and social engagement factors. The findings demonstrate the validity (χ2/df = 1.32) and reliability (Cronbach's α = 0.888) of the PPME-Q, establishing it as an effective tool for assessing eighth graders' mutual engagement in pair programming activities. As this tool is in the nascent stages of development the measurement, we emphasize the need for further empirical studies to establish criterion validity.

The fundamental structure of such a theory must include the domains of external basic entity interactions, external basic entity and information-coded energy quantum transformations, and energy quantum and information-coded matter interactions. In this respect, a human thinking system is perceived to have at least a natural energy-matter subsystem and a human-created physical symbol subsystem. The artifacts of the human-created subsystem are the external basic physical entities, namely, data, information, knowledge, and wisdom. The intrinsic and interactive properties of these entities depict the characteristics of the physical symbol subsystem. Besides interacting among themselves, the external entities also interact with the natural entities, the information-coded energy quanta, according to certain rules and principles. Subsequently, the energy quanta interact with the information-coded matter structure. Such interactions occurring within the individual subsystems and between the two subsystems constitute the dynamics of the human thinking systems. In intelligent systems of this nature information can exist in physical, energy and matter forms, and the different forms are interconvertible. The interactions among these entities and the conversion of one form to another is made possible by the existence of an intelligence space in the human mind.",,

This multilevel approach simultaneously explores SCP within the intricate school environment where factors at the school, teacher, and student levels are closely intertwined. Data was collected from 82 programming teachers and their 2433 students across 43 Hong Kong primary schools. Using multilevel modeling, results indicate that the adoption of SCP is significantly anchored by school support on teacher professional development (TPD), which in turn enhances students’ cognitive learning (i.e., active, interactive, constructive, and reflective learning) in class, further contributing to their enhanced cognitive CT abilities. The findings underscore the nuances of SCP adoption in school scenarios, advocating for strategic approaches to maximize student achievements in CT education.

Landauer's principle implies that the physical implementation of “logically irreversible” functions is accompanied by minimal entropy increase. We show that the multiple-computations theorem is incompatible with, or at least challenges, the universal validity of Landauer's principle. To this end we provide accounts of both ideas in terms of low-level fundamental concepts in statistical mechanics, thus providing a deeper understanding of these ideas than their standard formulations given in the high-level terms of thermodynamics and cognitive science. Since Landauer's principle is pivotal in the attempts to derive the universal validity of the second law of thermodynamics in statistical mechanics, our result entails that the multiple-computations theorem has crucial implications with respect to the second law. Finally, our analysis contributes to the understanding of notions, such as “logical irreversibility,” “entropy increase,” “implementing a computation,” in terms of fundamental physics, and to resolving open questions in the literature of both fields, such as: what could it possibly mean that a certain physical process implements a certain computation.",,"Entropy, Individuation of computation, Landauer's principle, Logical (ir)reversibility, Second law of thermodynamics"

In contrast to conventional differential evolution methods, DCS integrates a unique knowledge-acquisition process with a creative realism paradigm, thereby transforming optimization strategies. The primary aim of DCS is to enhance decision-making efficacy by employing a newly proposed dual-strategy approach that balances divergent and convergent thinking within a team-based framework. High-performing members apply divergent thinking via the DCS/Xrand/Linnik(α,σ) strategy, which incorporates existing knowledge and Linnik flights. Conversely, the remaining team harnesses convergent thinking through the DCS/Xbest/Current-to-2rand strategy, which combines insights from both the team leader and fellow members. This division of labor, coupled with a strategy tailored to the performance levels of team members, allows for a dynamic and effective decision-making process. The methodology of DCS involves iterative cycles of divergent and convergent thinking, supported by a differentiated knowledge-acquisition process and retrospective assessments. The algorithm's novelty lies in its differentiated knowledge-acquisition, adjusted based on individual team member performance, fostering an environment of continuous learning and adaptation. The paper's contributions are demonstrated through rigorous testing of DCS on various benchmark functions, including CEC2017, classical, and sensor selection problems, as well as real-world applications such as car side impact design, gear train design, and FM sound wave parameter estimation. The results showcase the promising performance of DCS compared to that of existing algorithms, attributable to its innovative approach to problem solving and decision making in complex scenarios.

Its impact is particularly notable in scenarios requiring a balance between innovative solutions and practical decision-making, making DCS a valuable asset in strategic planning and execution across various industries.",,"Population-based optimization algorithm, Divergent thinking, Convergent thinking, Linnik distribution, Creative realism, Differential evolution"

This family of processes, in fact, is of fundamental importance in solving problems in several industrial sectors, among which, for instance, are the management of oil spills, accidental industrial waste water dispersions, water treatment industry, engine fuel filtration and oil sand tailing technology. This paper, firstly, presents and discusses a biologically inspired design approach, based on biomimicry thinking (BT). Besides integrating linguistic tools and brainstorming within the BT approach, the importance of a stricter integration with the engineering context is also discussed. Secondly, the paper presents a practical application of this approach: design an innovative and sustainable oilwater separation device. In particular, the application of the proposed approach allowed identifying a bioinspired solution capable to improve the process performances in a device based on a known strategy. More in detail, the adopted bioinspired solution consists of a superoleophobic surface that mimics the microstructure of the filefish scale surface and eases the oilwater separation process by hindering oil drops deposition on some surfaces. The cost and resource effectiveness of the practical realisation of this surface greatly benefited by the latest advancements in the additive manufacturing field.",,"bioinspired, low-dimensional structures, oleophobic"

In this research, I show that if previous sales prices are round numbers, defined as multiples of £1,000 (e.g. £231,000), subsequent sales prices entail a considerable premium relative to similar properties that were previously priced at charm numbers that are marginally below those round numbers (e.g. £230,999 or £230,950). Using a sample of repeat sales from the Greater London region from 1995 to 2017, I estimate the premium to be approximately 4 percent after controlling for property characteristics and a large set of fixed effects. Increasing public accessibility of information attenuates the effect. Tax considerations, financial constraints, and pricing errors cannot explain the result.

Acknowledging the potential of computational design in enabling architects to manage design and coordination complexities and taking plasterboard opportunities for dimensional coordination, the paper presents a review and assessment of the existing methods to interrogate what, when, and how are these adaptable to the task. The study shows that ML-based methods outperform other methods and concludes that leveraging computational design powers to reduce offcuts is not a question of a tool, but one of a strategy.

They largely rely on static, deterministic or equilibrium-based models that facilitate in making decisions for well-behaved and predictable resource systems over time. These frameworks, however, are partly limited in their functionality due to the fact that they do not consider the exposure of systems to the dynamic nature of extrinsic uncertainties and the associated risks in the nexus. Hence, there is a need for a sequential learning, planning and optimal control modelling framework which could help achieve adaptive systems under volatile conditions with the objective to maximise economic output and enhance their operational resilience. In this paper, the authors discuss the development of a novel computational framework which incorporates “algorithmic resilience thinking” to achieve adaptive and robust inter-networked systems. Here, the question of adaptive systems for EWF nexus resilience is posed as a reinforcement learning problem based on sequential decision-making called the Markov decision process (MDP). The authors further discuss a case study, considering weather volatility, its spatial impact on vegetation, and the consequent risks on the water-food nexus for outdoor agricultural operations in the State of Qatar. The application of the developed framework particularly demonstrates promise in providing the functionality to track and mitigate emerging risks that have the potential to cause unprecedented disruption in the operations of integrated natural resource systems. The outcome of this study has positive implications for the advancement and effectiveness of EWF nexus planning and risk management to avert resource shortages and price risks, socio-economic disruption, and cascading failures of critical infrastructures, particularly when the global supply chains are subjected to stresses and shocks, such as extreme weather conditions.",,"Energy, water, and food nexus, Risk management, Artificial intelligence, Regime switching, Reinforcement learning"

Ten-year-old children are able to devise such programs to rearrange the order of the cars in trains on a simple railway track with a single siding. According to the theory, they rely on kinematic mental models that simulate the required sequence of steps, and we devised a computer program, mAbducer, which does so too in creating its own programs for such rearrangements. An experiment showed that a simple measure of the complexity of its programs, based on Kolmogorov complexity, predicts ten-year-olds’ difficulty in this task: the measure is the number of words in mAbducer’s programs for solving the rearrangement in a minimal number of moves. Complexity, in turn, reflects the structure of the required programs, which need loops of moves to be repeated, and often moves before and after such a loop. Children’s errors are predictable in both their location and nature. Our results therefore have implications for the assessment and pedagogy of computational thinking.",,"Computational thinking, Deduction, Informal programs, Kinematic simulations, Recursion"

To enhance student engagement and reduce the time spent on complex derivations, we propose a simplified approach that numerically evaluates Rp using standard software tools.

Humans are able to organize themselves in groups, engage in collaborative decision-making processes and arrive at a binding agreement, even in the absence of unanimous consent. However, the transfer of decision-making autonomy requires a willingness to deliberately expose oneself to the decisions of others. A lack of trust in the abilities of others or of the underlying decision-making process, i.e. public trust, can lead to a breakdown of organizations in political or economic domains. Recent studies indicate that the biological basis of trust on an individual level is related to Oxytocin, an endogenous neuropeptide and hormone, which is also associated with pro-social behavior and positive conflict resolution. However, little is known about the effects of Oxytocin on the inclination of individuals to form or join groups and to deliberately engage in collaborative decision-making processes. Here, we show that intranasal administration of Oxytocin (n = 60) compared to placebo (n = 60) in males causes an adverse effect on the choice for forming groups in the presence of a competitive environment. In particular, Oxytocin negatively affects the willingness to work collaboratively in a p-Beauty contest game, whereas the effect is most pronounced for participants with relatively high strategic sophistication. Since our data provide initial evidence that Oxytocin has a positive effect on strategic thinking and performance in the p-Beauty contest game, we argue that the adverse effect on group formation might be rooted in an enhanced strategic sophistication of participants treated with Oxytocin.",,

Practice Theory was used as the theoretical framework for the study. Interviews were supplemented with an explorative diary and photo assignment to bring unreflected choices and actions of planning travel to the conscious level. The results showed that travel planning involves the immediate situation where planning and decisions are made, but also aspirations, cognitive/time/material limitations, social norms and social relations that extend widely in time and space. Definitions of travel planning and travel information based on the situated practices of planning are suggested. In the muddle of everyday life, travel planning takes place in the brief moments where circumstances at different levels – time, place, the social realm - interact and are considered or directly acted upon.

The driver of this framework is a computational version of reflective equilibrium (RE), an approach that seeks coherence between considered judgments and governing principles. The framework has two goals: (i) to inform the engineering of ethical AI systems, and (ii) to characterize human moral judgment and decision-making in computational terms. Working jointly towards these two goals will create the opportunity to integrate diverse research questions, bring together multiple academic communities, uncover new interdisciplinary research topics, and shed light on centuries-old philosophical questions.",,"ethics, computation, moral psychology, AI ethics, machine ethics, moral cognition"

PHAST+ incorporates a highly efficient method for calculating accommodation and adaptation, making it particularly suited for simulations over extended stimulus durations. The proposed method uses a leaky integrator inspired by classic biophysical nerve models. Through evaluation against single-fiber animal data, our findings demonstrate the model’s effectiveness across various stimuli, including short pulse trains with variable amplitudes and rates. Notably, the PHAST+ model performs better than its predecessor, PHAST (a phenomenological model by van Gendt et al.), particularly in simulations of prolonged neural responses. While PHAST+ is optimized primarily on spike rate decay, it shows good behavior on several other neural measures, such as vector strength and degree of adaptation. The future implications of this research are promising. PHAST+ drastically reduces the computational burden to allow the real-time simulation of neural behavior over extended periods, opening the door to future simulations of psychophysical experiments and multi-electrode stimuli for evaluating novel speech-coding strategies for cochlear implants.",,"Neural model, Spike rate adaptation, Auditory nerve, Cochlear implants, Optimization, Evolutionary algorithms"

It remains unknown how misophonia relates to other psychiatric conditions or impairments. To identify latent constructs underlying symptoms, we conducted a factor analysis consisting of items from questionnaires assessing symptoms of misophonia and other psychiatric conditions. One thousand forty-two participants completed the questionnaires and a social exchange task in which they either could (“controllable”) or could not (“uncontrollable”) influence future monetary offers from other people. Misophonia and obsessive-compulsive (OC) symptoms loaded onto the same factor. Compared with individuals with low Miso-OC factor scores, individuals with high scores reported higher perceived controllability of their social interactions during the uncontrollable condition and stronger aversion to social norm violations in the uncontrollable compared with the controllable condition. Together, these results suggest misophonia, and OC symptoms share a latent psychiatric dimension characterized by aberrant computations of social controllability.",,"Biological sciences, Neuroscience, Behavioral neuroscience, Clinical neuroscience, Sensory neuroscience"

We argue that creative cognitive processes, divergent thinking, abstraction, and improvisation are constructed on different novelty-based processes. The prefrontal cortex plays a role in creative ideation by providing a control mechanism. Moreover, thinking about novel solutions activates the distant or loosely connected neurons of a semantic network that involves the hippocampus. Novelty can also be interpreted as different combinations of earlier learned processes, such as the motor sequencing mechanism of the basal ganglia. In addition, the cerebellum is responsible for the precise control of movements, which is particularly important in improvisation. Our neurocomputational perspective is based on three creative processes centered on novelty seeking, subserved by the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum, basal ganglia, and dopamine. The algorithmic implementation of our model would enable us to describe commonalities and differences between these creative processes based on the proposed neural circuitry.

We review behavioral and neuroscientific work that speaks to how causal structure shapes comprehension of and memory for narratives.

We show that within the computational theory of the mind the two problems are insoluble by the physics of the brain. We further show that attempts to solve the problems by the interactions of the systems implementing the computations with an environment (in or outside the brain) must introduce non-physical factors, and therefore fail on physical grounds. We also show that the problems are endemic and pertain to other forms of functional theories of the mind, most notably, causal functionalism. Finally, we propose a physicalist reductive identity theory, which is a generalization of statistical mechanics for all the special sciences, and show that only a theory of this kind can provide physical solutions to the above two problems in computational neuroscience.

Most participants are blinded by the abundance of digital devices and misled by the hardware and software providers who try to convince and force education systems to keep track of untraceable developments. However, recent studies have revealed that the productivity of the participants and the sustainability of their digital artifacts generate a huge but silent waste, both in terms of human and machine resources. This contradiction generates a paradox in which the illusion of digital prosperity does not allow us to clearly see the ineffectiveness of digital processes and artifacts and the losses piling up. Our research revealed that the methodology of Lean Thinking allows us to find the root causes of the problems and the revolutionary changes which must be applied to eliminate the waste generated by the participants in the digital era. It was also found that the adaptation of the lean philosophy, proven effective in production, services, and administration, can be a solution in resolving the paradox of digital education, which leads us to Lean Digital Education (LDE). Within this framework – instead of the widely accepted tool-centered ideas – we offer a human-centered, long-term thinking philosophy focusing on respect for participants, on their development, tasks, and problems, while at the same time eliminating and reducing waste.

Forming self-referential 2nd-order beliefs about what others think you will do seems to be a mixture of processes used to make choices and form beliefs. In equilibrium, there is little difference in neural activity across choice and belief tasks; there is a purely neural definition of equilibrium as a “state of mind.” “Strategic IQ,” actual earnings from choices and accurate beliefs, is negatively correlated with activity in the insula, suggesting poor strategic thinkers are too self-focused, and is positively correlated with ventral striatal activity (suggesting that high IQ subjects are spending more mental energy predicting rewards).",,

Although both careers involve physically and mentally demanding work, the risks to workers during the COVID-19 pandemic are not well understood. Nurses (both younger and older) are more likely to experience the ill effects of burnout and stress than construction workers, likely due to accelerated work demands and increased pressure on nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, we analyzed a large social media data set using advanced natural language processing techniques to explore indicators of the mental status of workers across both industries before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Objective This social media analysis aims to fill a knowledge gap by comparing the tweets of younger and older construction workers and nurses to obtain insights into any potential risks to their mental health due to work health and safety issues. Methods We analyzed 1,505,638 tweets published on Twitter (subsequently rebranded as X) by younger and older (aged <45 vs >45 years) construction workers and nurses. The study period spanned 54 months, from January 2018 to June 2022, which equates to approximately 27 months before and 27 months after the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic on March 11, 2020. The tweets were analyzed using big data analytics and computational linguistic analyses. Results Text analyses revealed that nurses made greater use of hashtags and keywords (both monograms and bigrams) associated with burnout, health issues, and mental health compared to construction workers. The COVID-19 pandemic had a pronounced effect on nurses’ tweets, and this was especially noticeable in younger nurses. Tweets about health and well-being contained more first-person singular pronouns and affect words, and health-related tweets contained more affect words. Sentiment analyses revealed that, overall, nurses had a higher proportion of positive sentiment in their tweets than construction workers. However, this changed markedly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Since early 2020, sentiment switched, and negative sentiment dominated the tweets of nurses. No such crossover was observed in the tweets of construction workers. Conclusions The social media analysis revealed that younger nurses had language use patterns consistent with someone experiencing the ill effects of burnout and stress. Older construction workers had more negative sentiments than younger workers, who were more focused on communicating about social and recreational activities rather than work matters. More broadly, these findings demonstrate the utility of large data sets enabled by social media to understand the well-being of target populations, especially during times of rapid societal change.",,"social media, construction, nursing, aging, health and well-being, Twitter"

Emerging evidence suggests that the cerebellum plays a critical role in cognitive functions, including language processing. This study leverages Natural Language Processing to objectively measure language disturbances in patients with first-episode psychosis and investigates the relationship between these disturbances and cerebellar structure. Methods Fifty-four patients with schizophrenia, either drug-naïve or minimally medicated, were recruited from an early psychosis program. Impoverished thought was assessed using the Thought Language Index while lexico-semantic features (affect, cognitive, linguistic, perception, time) were identified from speech samples analyzed using the Linguistic Inquiry Word Count-22 software. Structural cerebellar analysis was completed on 7.0 Tesla MRI scans using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) to measure global and regional grey matter volume changes. Results Linear regression analysis revealed that reduced perceptual word usage was the strongest predictor of impoverished thinking. Correlational analysis identified reduced cerebellar volumes in patients with lower LIWC-based perception scores. VBM localized this relationship to a cluster in the right posterolateral cerebellar hemisphere, an area related to executive demand and verb generation function. Conclusion The cerebellum contributes to impoverished thinking in early psychosis, likely by influencing the lexical expression of perceptual experiences. This underscores the cerebellum's role in higher-order cognitive processes relevant to psychotic disorders and its potential as a therapeutic target for language and cognitive deficits in schizophrenia.",,

Established theories explain neuroticism in terms of threat sensitivity, but have limited heuristic value since they cannot account for features of neuroticism that are unrelated to threat, such as creativity and negative psychological states experienced in benign, threat-free environments. We address this issue by proposing that neuroticism stems from trait individual differences in activity in brain circuits that govern the nature of self-generated thought (SGT). We argue our theory explains not only the association of neuroticism with threat sensitivity but also the prominence within the neurotic mind of representations of information that are unrelated to the way the world is right now, such as creativity and nonsituational ‘angst’.",,"personality, neuroticism, creativity, self-generated thought, medial prefrontal cortex"

Two issues related to this view are comprised by the goal of this paper: A) Computing systems are traditionally seen as representational systems, but functional and enactive approaches support non-representational theories; B) Recently, a sociocultural theory against computationalism was proposed with the aim of ontologically reducing computing to cognition. We defend, however, that cognition and computation are in action, thus cognition is just a form of computing and that cognition is the explanatory basis for computation. We state that: 1. Representational theories of computing recurring to intentional content run into metaphysical problems. 2. Functional non-representational theories do not incur this metaphysical problem when describing computing in terms of the abstract machine. 3. Functional theories are consistent with enactive in describing computing machines not in a strictly functional way, but especially in terms of their organization. 4. Enactive cognition is consistent with the computationalism in describing Turing machines as functionally and organizationally closed systems. 5. The cognitive explanatory basis for computing improves the computational theory of cognition. When developed in the human linguistic domain, computer science is seen as a product of human socionatural normative practices, however, cognition is just an explanatory, not ontological, basis for computing. The paper concludes by supporting that computation is in action, that cognition is just one form of computing in the world and the explanatory basis for computation.",,"Cognitive systems, Enaction, Computing, Socio-natural practices"

Chafee Foster Care Program for Successful Transition to Adulthood (CFCIP) allocates funding to provide services to youth who are likely to age out of foster care. These services, covering everything from mentoring to financial aid, are expected to be distributed in ways that prepare youth for life after care. One natural question to ask is, which youth receive Chafee services? The present work makes use of the National Youth in Transition Database (NYTD), a large-scale administrative dataset that tracks services allocated to youth that use CFCIP funds to answer this question. Specifically, we conduct a forensic social science analysis of the NYTD data. To do so, we first use computational methods to help us uncover the factors that best predict which youth will receive services associated with service receipt. We find that the majority of variables in the Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System (AFCARS) and NYTD have limited or no utility in predicting Chafee service receipt, and that a subset of three variables—youth age, youth time in care, and the state in which a youth is in care—explain almost all variability in service receipt. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of these and other findings on future research on Chafee service allocation, and the utility of predictive modeling in child welfare, with a particular focus on the utility of the NYTD in this context.",,"Chafee services, Computational social science, Predictive modeling, National Youth in Transition Database"

An applicative approach is systematically applied to build a concept-as-process design. Since modern computing considers information processes as the main objects of modeling, the developed design is indeed representative of the semantic processing of information. The nature of concepts – what concepts are – and the constraints that govern the theory of concepts have been, and continue to be, the subject of debate. It is especially interesting to discuss the nature of concepts in connection with the recently established fundamental nature of information processes that are attributable to all phenomena and events occurring in the world around us. The current trend elevates information processes to forms of computing, which can also be implemented through practices, for example, in the form of programming. The deep component is computational models, one way or another expressed by means of mathematics and metamathematics. The main meta-operations used are abstraction and application. Of greatest interest is functional abstraction and application in the form of applying a function to an argument. Despite this “conceptual minimalism”, a rich theory of concepts can be developed. Using this theory, it is possible to focus further discussion not only on the nature of concepts, but also to characterize the position on each of the five important issues that are central to many theories of concepts: (1) ontology of concepts, (2) structure of concepts, (3) empiricism, and nativism about concepts, (4) concepts and natural language, and (5) concepts and conceptual analysis.",,"concept-as-a-process, application, abstraction, conceptual minimalism, computational model"

Recent cross-sectional studies indicated decision-making deficits in depression, which may be an important contributor to the disorder. Our goal was to test whether description- and experience-based decision making, two major neuroeconomic paradigms of decision-making under uncertainty, predict future depressive symptoms in young adults. Methods One hundred young adults performed two decision-making tasks, one description-based, in which subjects chose between two gambling options given explicitly stated rewards and their probabilities, and the other experience-based, in which subjects were shown rewards but had to learn the probability of those rewards (or cue-outcome contingencies) via trial-and-error experience. We evaluated subjects' depressive symptoms with BDI-II at baseline (T1) and half a year later (T2). Results Comparing subjects with low versus high levels of depressive symptoms at T2 showed that the latter performed worse on the experience- but not description-based task at T1. Computational modeling of the decision-making process suggested that subjects with high levels of depressive symptoms had a more concave utility function, indicating enhanced risk aversion. Furthermore, a more concave utility function at T1 increased the odds of high depressive symptoms at T2, even after controlling depressive symptoms at T1, perceived stress at T2, and several covariates (OR = 0.251, 95% CI [0.085, 0.741]). Conclusions This is the first study to demonstrate a prospective link between experience-based decision-making and depressive symptoms. Our results suggest that enhanced risk aversion in experience-based decision-making may be an important contributor to the development of depressive symptoms.",,"Decision-making, Description-experience gap, Risk preference, Probability weighting, Reinforcement learning, Computational psychiatry"

Therefore, we reconstructed human cognitive evolution by projecting nonsynonymous/synonymous rate ratios (ω values) in mammalian phylogeny onto the anatomically modern human (AMH) brain. This atlas retraces human neurogenetic selection and allows imputation of ancestral evolution in task-related functional networks (FNs). Adaptive evolution (high ω values) is associated with excitatory neurons and synaptic function. It shifted from FNs for motor control in anthropoid ancestry (60–41 mya) to attention in ancient hominoids (26–19 mya) and hominids (19–7.4 mya). Selection in FNs for language emerged with an early hominin ancestor (7.4–1.7 mya) and was later accompanied by adaptive evolution in FNs for strategic thinking during recent (0.8 mya–present) speciation of AMHs. This pattern mirrors increasingly complex cognitive demands and suggests that co-selection for language alongside strategic thinking may have separated AMHs from their archaic Denisovan and Neanderthal relatives.",,"evolutionary genetics, neurogenetic evolution, computational neuroanatomy, human cognition, archaic brains, Neanderthal, Denisovan, language, attention, strategic thinking"

It explains that thinking is a social activity; human culture and cognition are aspects of a single process. A recent simulation of the spread of culture provides insights into the effects of social interaction and gives a starting point for demonstrating that a small number of simple principles can cause an artificial system to behave remarkably like a complex human society.

To achieve this goal, in the past decades, research has been conducted to investigate the influence of the indoor environment on occupants. Thermal comfort has been the subject of most investigations in this field. However, despite being a consolidated research topic since the 1920s, statistical practices for analysing thermal comfort data often rely on simplified premises, which may be due to several possible factors (e.g., limited computational capabilities and lack of training). Consequently, important aspects of data analysis are often absent or overlooked. Recent statistics and statistical software advances have provided more options for effectively modelling complex issues. However, properly using these tools requires a solid understanding of statistical analysis, increasing the risk of misuse in practice. This paper presents ten questions highlighting the most critical issues regarding statistical analysis for thermal comfort research and practice. The first four questions provide general perspectives concerning statistical data analysis, while the remaining ones address specific problems related to thermal comfort research, but that can extend to all human-centric research in the built environment. Additionally, the last five questions demonstrate the practical significance of analysis pitfalls (i.e., sampling variability, selection bias, variable selection, clustered/nested observations, and measurement error) through examples with synthetic data.

Central retinal vessels (CRVs) oriented asymmetrically in the ONH are the single blood supply source to the retina and are believed to act as mechanically stable elements in the ONH in response to intraocular pressure (IOP). However, these mechanical effects are considered negligible in ONH biomechanical studies and received less attention. This study investigated the effects of CRVs on ONH biomechanics taking into consideration three-dimensional asymmetric CRV geometries. A CRV geometry was constructed based on CRV centerlines extracted from optical coherence tomography ONH images in eight healthy subjects and superimposed in the idealized ONH geometry established in previous studies. Mechanical analyses of the ONH in response to the IOP were conducted in the cases with and without CRVs for comparison. Obtained results demonstrated that the CRVs induced anisotropic ONH deformation, particularly in the lamina cribrosa and the associated upper neural tissues (prelamina) with wide ranges of spatial strain distributions. These results indicated that the CRVs result in anisotropic deformation with local strain concentration, rather than function to mechanically support in response to the IOP as in the conventional thinking in ophthalmology.",,"Central retinal vessel, Optic nerves head, Optical coherence tomography, Glaucoma, Smoothed finite element method"

Three distinct and widely used features – Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), Local Binary Patterns (LBP), and Principal components (PCs) extracted from target images are used in a manner which is simple, and yet effective. The HOG and LBP features further undergo Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction. Our model uses multi-layer perceptrons (MLP) to classify these three features and fuse them to form a sparsely connected model. A computational theory is first developed by using concepts from the information processing mechanism of the brain. Extensive experiments are carried out using eight publicly available face datasets to validate our proposed model’s performance in recognizing faces with extreme variation of illumination, pose angle, expression, and background.

To this aim, we engage with contributions to socio-metabolic studies, notably from social ecology, that are not directly concerned with the urban dimension but explicitly question how systems and actors shape each other and how social practices can influence the distribution of resource flows and stocks and their interdependencies. Based on those contributions, we identify three critical axes of investigation that help track implicit uses of the concept of “agency” in urban metabolism studies and constitute the pillars of our proposed framework: (1) characterizing structures comprising urban social-ecological systems – understood as patterns of connections among elements and subsystems – as actors, (2) identifying the chains of events that such actors influence by exerting their agentic capacities, and (3) associating those same actors with definite agentic dimensions, i.e., specific modalities of agency. By drawing on methods from computational linguistics, text mining, and semantic network analysis, we extract concepts cognate to “urban metabolism” from a relevant body of research literature. Through our framework, we show how such concepts define forms of agency that can be ascribed to structural components of urban social-ecological systems.",,"Urban metabolism, Agency, Social ecology, Stock-flow-practice nexus, Semantic network analysis, Computational linguistics, Text mining"

Lack of assessment procedures make it difficult to evaluate the progress made during the implementation of LT. The current study attempts to address this gap by developing and demonstrating an assessment procedure to evaluate the extent of lean implementation in a healthcare institution To begin with, different lean tenets and elements applied in healthcare institutions were identified through a literature review. Following it, a Fuzzy-Logic Input Based Healthcare Institution Lean Implementation Assessment (FLB-HLIA) was developed and deployed in an Indian case hospital to compute “Healthcare Institution’s Lean Implementation Index” (HLII). FLB-HLIA revealed that the case hospital has to focus on two lean tenets, namely establishing pull system, and seeking perfection, to improve its HLII. Assessment also revealed the lean elements that the case hospital can focus to upgrade its HLII. HLII can be used by practitioners to perform intra-benchmarking and inter-benchmarking of healthcare institutions.

While such integrative curricula are expected in a graduate school setting, they are challenging at the undergraduate level since they require proficiency in multiple disciplines. However, making this transition to interdisciplinary, project-based teaching at the undergraduate level gives a competitive edge to undergraduates. As part of a broader effort of developing a comprehensive neuroscience curriculum, we implemented an interdisciplinary, one-semester, upper-level course called Biophysical Modeling of Excitable Cells (BMEC). The course exposes undergraduate students to broad areas of computational biology. It focuses on computational neuroscience, develops scientific literacy, and promotes teamwork between biology, psychology, physics, and mathematics-oriented undergraduates. This course also provides pedagogical experience for senior Ph.D. students in Neuroscience. BMEC is a three contact hours per week lecture-based course that includes a set of computer-based activities designed to gradually increase the undergraduates’ ability to apply mathematics and computational concepts to solving biologically-relevant problems. The class brings together two different groups of students with very dissimilar and complementary backgrounds, i.e., biology/psychology and physics/mathematics oriented. The teamwork allows students with more substantial biology/psychology backgrounds to explain to physics/mathematics students the biological implications and instill realism into the computer modeling project they completed for this class. Simultaneously, students with substantial physics/mathematics backgrounds can apply techniques learned in specialized mathematics, physics, or computer science classes to generate mathematical hypotheses and implement them in computer codes. This study expands on Oprisan (2021) by including examples of hands-on activities, student projects, and a brief overview of course assessment tools and results.

Concurrently, calls for integrating CT concepts within authentic science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) contexts have also increased. This is reflected by the inclusion of CT in the Next Generation Science Standards and the Standards for Technological and Engineering Literacy. However, methods for teaching CT concepts within secondary level STEM courses vary drastically. Physical computing, the design and programming of physical systems or devices using computational thinking skills, has become increasingly popular in the U.S. in attempts to integrate CT within authentic STEM problem-solving contexts. Despite this rise in popularity, there remains a limited but growing body of research investigating physical computing pedagogy and student learning. A mixed methods design was used in this study to examine 170 middle school students’ attitudes toward coding and after participating in either a screen-based or physical computing unit. The results indicated that students who completed the screen-based unit reported statistically greater attitudes toward the classroom applications and career/future use of computing concepts. Students in the treatment group believed that physical computing made learning computing concepts more difficult, but they preferred the hands-on learning opportunities provided by physical computing. Furthermore, male students reported higher attitudinal ratings than females regarding the influence computing would have on their future academic and career choices.

An expanded theory of emergence in which visual cognition plays an important role is presented. Beginning with an attempt to broaden the perceptual perspectives of shape emergence, the process of cognitive emergence is defined. The duality of related perceptual and cognitive components provides a working basis for conceptualizing visual emergence in design. Antithetical to the idea of accidental emergence, it is proposed that emergence is guided and anticipated. We claim that it is the re-cognition of visual shapes and images in design that enables emergence. This kind of guidance function in emergence is termed ‘anticipated emergence’. We demonstrate how high-level domain knowledge of visual forms can be accommodated as cognitive content, and how this can contribute to establishing a cognitive basis for emergence.

The design of new substances entails the design of new molecules, and the design of more benign processes may entail the design of other substances (besides reactants and products) facilitating the process' ‘greenness’, from catalysts to green solvents. Designing molecules with specific properties requires the possibility of predicting their properties before the actual synthesis. Computational chemistry has made molecular design rational by being able to predict the properties of not-yet-synthesized molecules. The results of molecular calculations enable a preliminary selection singling out the promising molecules among a high number of possibilities; only the promising ones are then synthesized and experimentally tested. Synergies between computational chemistry and green chemistry would thus appear a natural outcome. The present work outlines them with reference to the main components of an industrial process and of their potential ‘greening’. The presentation follows a pattern that can be used within educational contexts. The conclusions stress the importance to familiarise students with the variety of possible synergies and the benefits of each of them, within a perspective viewing a ‘knowing each other’ criterion as the main key to nurture true cross-areas attitudes, that will be valuable for the students' future professional activities.",,"Design of new molecules, Education to cross-disciplinary attitudes, Prediction of, Molecular properties, Prediction of reaction mechanisms"

Once the goats are in the herd on the farm and the responsibility of the farmer or farm manager, the expression and proliferation of the genotype will be strongly influenced by environmental factors. If maximum milk production per lactation were the real and only goal that could promise farm business and land sustainability, genetic selection would be easy. However, the real goal on farms is to have healthy goats that produce efficiently and are adapted to their environment. This places the development of the goat breeding program in the hands of farmers. To aid farmers in moving beyond the use of total milk production per goat as the feedback mechanism to farm sustainability, the integration of more appropriate progress indicators could include longevity (which, in humans, is estimated at 20% genetic and 80% environmental), the amount of milk or milk component production per body weight of goat, and the degree of involuntary culling.",,"Dairy goat breeding and selection, Extensive grazing, Longevity, Milk production, Efficiency, Environmental adaptation"

This method can obtain explicit expressions of parameters, facilitating seamless integration into photovoltaic systems for circuit-level simulation and design. The proposed method addresses the lack of analytical parameter extraction methods for triple-diode model, avoids the iteration of numerical methods, and significantly reduces computational complexity, thus improving the overall efficiency of the modeling process. In this method, the principle of effective-diode-based analysis is used to simplify the complex multi-diode model. Recursive thinking is then combined to adaptively extract all parameters through multiple steps according to the number of diodes in the model. Subsequently, the practicability of this method is evaluated by testing on three different equivalent circuit models of solar cells including the single-, double-, and triple-diode models. Furthermore, the universality of this method is demonstrated by testing on three photovoltaic modules of different types including Mono-crystalline, Multi-crystalline, Thin-film, and perovskite solar cells at different temperatures and irradiances. Finally, the simulation results based on the extracted parameters are compared with the experimental data to calculate the root mean square error (RMSE) magnitude, which ranges from 10−5 to 10−3, demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed method.

Methods We first generated an unsupervised topic model from 6563 posts made to 2 dementia-specific subreddit forums (r/Alzheimers and r/dementia). Then, we conducted a manual qualitative content analysis of a random subset of these data to further explore salient themes in the corpus. Results The topic model with the highest overall coherence score (0.38) included 10 topics, including caregiver burden, anxiety, support-seeking, and AD/ADRD behavioral symptomology.

The design used in this assessment provides a framework for considering teacher development and student assessment simultaneously. Results show that students taught by project teachers performed better in both classroom problem-solving activities and task-based interviews than students taught by nonproject teachers. In addition, there were major differences in the problem-solving behaviors of the two groups. Experimental students (students of project teachers) displayed greater mathematical confidence, and were more likely to see mathematics as a powerful way of thinking about the real world and approach mathematics as such.",,"mathematics education, problem solving, teacher development"

It starts by classifying different types of functionally graded (FG) materials such as conventional, axial, bi-directional, and tri-directional, and the material distribution models like power-law, exponential, trigonometric, polynomial functions, etc. It also discusses the application of advanced size-dependent theories like Eringen’s nonlocal elasticity, nonlocal strain gradient, modified couple stress, and consistent couple stress theories, which are essential to predict the behavior of structures at small scales. The review covers the mechanical analysis of MDFG nanostructures in nanobeams, nanopipes, nanoplates, and nanoshells and their dynamic and static responses under different loading conditions. The effect of multi-directional material gradation on stiffness, stability and vibration is discussed. Moreover, the review highlights the need for more advanced analytical, semi-analytical, and numerical methods to solve the complex vibration problems of MDFG nanostructures. It is evident that the continued development of these methods is crucial for the design, optimization, and real-world application of MDFG nanostructures in advanced engineering fields like aerospace, biomedicine, and micro/nanoelectromechanical systems (MEMS/NEMS).

Scotland is no exception and MSP is central to its management plans. The interpretation and use of spatial data informs these plans and maps provide the backbone of the decision-making process. Whilst not refuting MSP as a governance tool, this paper examines more closely some of the inherent problems with representing marine environments spatially and how the practice of map-making inevitably interacts with social-ecological networks. Borrowing from critical cartography and Actor-Network Theory (ANT), four observations are made: 1) due to the necessary procedure of categorising and simplifying data, maps do not always accurately represent changeable marine environments and situations; 2) maps can produce reality as much as represent it; 3) mapping has become the point through which all actors and stakeholders must pass; 4) as they are obliged to pass through this point, the roles and definition of certain actors can change. This discussion of marine spatial planning in Scotland demonstrates what can be learnt from viewing marine spaces as a tightly coupled social-ecological environment.",,

While past work has emphasized the information value of direct social interactions (such as watching someone help or hinder others), social tendencies can also be inferred from indirect evidence, such as how an agent considers others when making personal choices. Here we present a computational model of this capacity, grounded in a Bayesian framework for action understanding. Across four experiments we show that this model captures how people infer social preferences based on how agents act when their choices indirectly impact others (Experiments 1a, 1b, & 1c), and how people infer what an agent knows about others from knowledge of that agent’s social preferences (Experiment 2). Critically, people’s patterns of inferences could not be explained by simpler alternatives. These findings illuminate how people can discern potential social partners from indirect evidence of their prosociality, thus deepening our understanding of partner detection, and social cognition more broadly.",,"Theory of mind, Social mindfulness, Computational modeling, Naive utility calculus"

When available at the primary school level, AI literacy is often taught within computer science courses, which may potentially reinforce gender stereotypes and discourage female students' engagement. In AI literacy education, the predominant teaching methods are constructivist approaches, which, while effective in fostering active learning, heavily emphasize technical skills and are therefore limited in their pedagogical scope, as they underplay other important questions, such as disinformation, data justice, and AI's ethical and societal implications. The lack of a clear definition of AI literacy for primary education also raises questions about what to teach and how to teach it. Additionally, little attention has been devoted to understanding gender differences in learning outcomes within AI literacy primary education. This study advocates the use of an arts-based transdisciplinary approach for teaching AI literacy to 25 primary school students. A pilot study utilizing mixed methods was conducted to assess the effectiveness of this arts-based approach. Quantitative analysis through a paired t-test revealed a statistically significant improvement in AI literacy among students participating in knowledge tests. Moreover, the results of the Mann‒Whitney and Kruskal‒Wallis tests indicated that gender and age did not impact pre- and post-knowledge test scores. Qualitative analyses further revealed the pedagogical benefits of the arts-based approach, demonstrating that students enhance their conceptual understanding of AI literacy by reflecting on their artifacts. This study contributes to the literature by providing evidence with a small sample size that the arts-based approach can overcome age and gender barriers to accessing AI literacy education and can serve as a means to teach AI thinking.",,"Artificial intelligence, AI literacy education, AI thinking, Primary school students, Arts-based pedagogy, Age and gender difference"

Here, we bridge this gap and review recent progress in computational models for subjective feelings. For example, happiness reflects not how well people are doing, but whether they are doing better than expected. This dependence on recent reward prediction errors is intact in major depression, although depressive symptoms lower happiness during tasks. Uncertainty predicts subjective feelings of stress in volatile environments. Social prediction errors influence feelings of self-worth more in individuals with low self-esteem despite a reduced willingness to change beliefs due to social feedback. Measuring affective state during behavioral tasks provides a tool for understanding psychiatric symptoms that can be dissociable from behavior.

Neurophysiological evidence suggests that oscillatory alpha activity is correlated with visual-figurative creative thinking. However, whether alpha oscillations play a functional role in generating graphic symbols remains unclear. To address this issue, we compared the EEG alpha power of 40 healthy adults while ideating creative and conventional graphic symbols representing an abstract concept’s meaning (e.g., the word ’peace’). Our results revealed that the ideation of graphic symbols elicited alpha synchronization, with higher levels in the conventional compared to the creative condition, mainly over frontal-central, frontal-temporal, parietal-occipital, and occipital regions. Furthermore, we observed greater alpha synchronization in the right hemisphere than in the left across both conditions, particularly between temporal, central-parietal, and parietal electrodes. This asymmetry extended to central electrodes in the creative condition, while in the conventional condition, it was more pronounced over parietal-occipital regions. Finally, we also found that frontal and occipital alpha synchronization during the creative ideation phase predicted the subsequent originality scores of the graphic symbols produced. Together, these findings enhance our understanding of the dynamics of oscillatory alpha activity during graphic symbol creation, shedding light on how the interaction between inhibitory top-down control mechanisms and cognitive flexibility processes facilitates the transformation of abstract concepts into visual forms. These findings provide new insights into the neural processes underlying this uniquely human ability.",,"Divergent thinking, Alpha band, Convergent thinking, Cognitive control, Cognitive flexibility, Power activity"

Classical philosophy of formal languages as well as symbolic AI assume that all kinds of knowledge must explicitly be represented by formal or programming languages. This assumption is limited by recent insights into the biology of evolution and developmental psychology of the human organism. Most of our knowledge is implicit and unconscious. It is not formally represented, but embodied knowledge, which is learnt by doing and understood by bodily interacting with changing environments. That is true not only for low-level skills, but even for high-level domains of categorization, language, and abstract thinking. The embodied mind is considered an emergent capacity of the brain as a self-organizing complex system. Actually, self-organization has been a successful strategy of evolution to handle the increasing complexity of the world. Genetic programs are not sufficient and cannot prepare the organism for all kinds of complex situations in the future. Self-organization and emergence are fundamental concepts in the theory of complex dynamical systems. They are also applied in organic computing as a recent research field of computer science. Therefore, cognitive science, AI, and robotics try to model the embodied mind in an artificial evolution.

Such a methodology enables a systematic information gathering and organization that results in a deep understanding of actual problems, needs and expectations from the target stakeholders. The uniqueness of problems and the need for situation-specific data makes knowledge re-use not always practical, even within the most consolidated and experienced environments. In this paper we propose an ontological support to empathy mapping that aims to (i) establish an interoperable fine-grained data layer among the different data collected throughout the empathy mapping process, (ii) enable multi-scenario analysis underpinned by formal specifications and (iii) further empower the process through semantic enrichment and integration of insight from multiple sources and contexts.

It is associated with strong emotional responses of regret (when the obtained outcome is inferior to the counterfactual) and relief (vice versa). Counterfactual thinking may play a role in various cognitive phenomena in disordered gambling, such as the effects of near-misses. This study compared individuals with gambling disorder (n = 46) and healthy controls (n = 25) on a behavioural economic choice task that entailed choosing between two gambles, designed to measure counterfactual thinking. Participants provided affect ratings following both the obtained and the non-obtained outcomes. Choices were analyzed using a computational model that derived parameters reflecting sensitivity to expected value, risk variance, and anticipated regret. In the computational choice model, the group with gambling disorder showed increased sensitivity to anticipated regret, reduced sensitivity to expected value, and increased preference for high risk-variance gambles. On the affect ratings, the group with gambling disorder displayed blunted emotional sensitivity to obtained and counterfactual outcomes. Effect sizes of the group differences were modest. Participants with gambling disorder show wide-ranging alterations in decision-making processes and emotional reactivity to choice outcomes.

A set-oriented perspective (Lockwood, 2014) is a way of thinking about counting problems that emphasizes the importance of reasoning about the set of outcomes being counted. From a set-oriented perspective, one possible type of intervention is to have students focus on the sets of outcomes rather than formulas and expressions, and specifically to reason about the structure of the set of outcomes. Yet, reasoning about sets of outcomes is not sufficient for students to make connections between outcomes and counting processes. In this paper, we investigate tasks where students wrote computer code to enumerate the set of outcomes in a specific order by implementing listing processes, and they were then asked to determine a specific numbered outcome in their list by using the structure of their enumeration scheme. We clarify particular aspects of a set-oriented perspective that were productive for students, and we demonstrate that tasks that asked students to name a specific outcome in their list elicited meaningful connections between counting processes and sets of outcomes.

According to our model, each partner in the interaction attempts to minimize the prediction error of the self and the interaction partner. In most cases, these inferential models become similar over time, thus enabling mutual understanding to develop. At the neural level, this type of social learning may be supported by interbrain plasticity, defined as a change in interbrain coupling over time in neural networks associated with social learning, among them the mentalizing network, the observation-execution system, and the hippocampus.

These algorithms result in erroneous solutions termed rational errors. Computationally, students' erroneous algorithms can be represented by perturbations or bugs in otherwise correct arithmetic algorithms (Brown & VanLehn, 1980; Langley & Ohilson, 1984; VanLehn, 1983, 1986, 1990; Young S O'Sheo, 1981). Bugs are useful for describing how rational errors occur but bugs are not sufficient for explaining their origin. A possible explanation for this is that rational errors are the result of incorrect induction from examples. This prediction is termed the “induction hypothesis” (VanLehn, 1986). The purpose of the present study was to: (a) expand on post formulations of the induction hypothesis, and (b) use a new methodology to test the induction hypothesis more carefully than has been done previously.

In this respect, this mathematical framework offers a conceptual knowledge representation through the Galois lattice. This hierarchical conceptual structure has been beneficial within the task of knowledge discovery in databases. However, its effective use in large datasets is always limited by the overwhelming number of extracted formal concepts. To select interesting formal concepts, the stability measure can be of valuable help. The dedicated literature has highlighted non-scalable approaches to compute such a stability measure. In an effort to tackle this issue, we introduce the Dfsp algorithm dedicated to efficiently compute the quality measure of the stability of formal concepts. We also show that the stability computation is an instantiation of a larger issue: locating minimal generators given the closed pattern as a reference point. The guiding idea of the Dfsp algorithm is to maximize as far as possible the quantity of the useless search space through the swift localization of maximal non-generator cliques. The experiments performed demonstrate the efficiency of the Dfsp algorithm.",,"Data mining, Pattern selection, Formal concept analysis, Formal concept, Interestingness measure, Stability measure, Minimal generator"

In this social neuroscience study, we scanned 121 vaccine-supporters using magnetoencephalography to evaluate three levels of polarisation: explicit, implicit, and neural — and then to test whether exposing people to extreme ingroup perspectives (following the paradoxical thinking principles) or extreme outgroup perspectives can modulate those levels of affective polarisation between vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. We show that a neural proxy for intergroup polarisation, expressed as late prefrontal beta rhythm suppression, can detect subtle changes in affective polarisation. More specifically, we find that exposing vaccine-supporters to extreme ingroup (i.e., pro-vaccination) viewpoints leads to a decrease in this neural proxy of affective polarisation. Conversely, exposure to extreme outgroup (i.e., anti-vaccination) narratives increases polarisation, which in turn predicts a decrease in positive affect towards vaccine opposers almost one year later. Altogether, the results show that although it may seem intuitive to expose people to counter-arguments (i.e., extreme outgroup perspectives) to change their opinions, such an approach can backlash and increase polarisation instead. However, using subtler methods such as the paradoxical thinking intervention (i.e., extreme ingroup perspectives) for attitude change can have the desired effects and reduce intergroup polarisation.",,"Social neuroscience, Affective polarisation, Covid-19 vaccination, Intergroup interventions, Magnetoencephalography, paradoxical thinking, IAT"

To capture the robustness of natural cognitive development, a new approach is proposed here that enables the formation of new higher cognitive abilities in a model system, embedded in an unexpected environment. This is achieved based on the naturally developing grounding of innate abstract constructs (schemas). The mechanism producing this binding is that of creative insight. In this study, principles of insight processes borrowed from psychology are formalized and adapted for computer modeling. To do this, several examples of insight phenomena at different evolutionary levels and in different species are analyzed before the model is formulated based on the dual process theory, the signal model of insight, and the eBICA cognitive architecture framework. Results of its computer simulations prove the concept. One specific finding is that the accumulation of activation during the incubation period increases creative abilities of the system.

It is to be hoped that, eventually, computer scientists will find complexity issues involving real-number computations to be challenging, worthwhile, and central to the understanding of theoretical computation.

This approach would facilitate the encoding of the (common) human functions as precisely as the machine language instructions for a computer. Conversely, the approach would facilitate the transfer of the lower-level intelligence of a human being into the adaptation of the HW, SW, and FW modules of an intelligent machine. Though not entirely feasible, the approach digs deep inroads in how human intelligent-machines can be and conversely, how robotic mundane-human beings can be. The later situation occurs in prisoner-, slave-, military-camps. The methodology is practical since machines have already started to imitate human behavior and some of the human tasks are routine and programmable into the robots. The challenge lies when some of the higher levels functions (such as conceptualize, hypothesize, optimize, generalize, axiomize, etc.) of human beings need to be programed into intelligent machines, even though middle level functions (such as summarize, generalize, rationalize, etc.) can be forced by appropriate knowledge-ware (KW) into intelligent machines. These middle level functions are encoded into the KW by searching for embedded knowledge centric objects (KCOs) in human beings, cultures, societies, and other contributing objects. Related and pertinent knowledge is found by exploring the local and the Internet knowledge bases (KBs) and selecting the attributes of these objects and or related objects.

Given these properties, computational models of metacognition provide an empirically-tractable early step in characterizing the generative process that constructs qualitative experience.

Computational modeling of the mind has focused on rule-governed behavior, ultimately trying to reduce them to rules of logic. What if thinking is less like reasoning and more like believing? I argue that the classical model of thought as rational is mistaken and that thinking is fundamentally constituted by believing. This new approach forces us to re-evaluate classical epistemic concepts like “truth”, “justification” etc. Furthermore, if thinking is believing, then it is not clear how thoughts can be modeled computationally.

Such diversity of collision selectivity can serve locusts to escape from attack by natural enemies, and migrate in swarm free of collision. For computational studies, endeavours have been made to realize the diverse selectivity which, however, is still one of the most challenging tasks especially in complex and dynamic real world scenarios. The existing models are mainly formulated as multi-layered neural networks with merely feed-forward information processing, and do not take into account the effect of re-entrant signals in feedback loop, which is an essential regulatory loop for motion perception, yet never been explored in looming perception. In this paper, we inaugurate feedback neural computation for constructing a new LGMD-based model, named F-LGMD to look into the efficacy upon implementing different collision selectivity. Accordingly, the proposed neural network model features both feed-forward processing and feedback loop. The feedback control propagates output signals of parallel ON/OFF channels back into their starting neurons, thus makes part of the feed-forward neural network, i.e. the ON/OFF channels and the feedback loop form an iterative cycle system. Moreover, the feedback control is instantaneous, which leads to the existence of a fixed point whereby the fixed point theorem is applied to rigorously derive valid range of feedback coefficients. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct systematic experiments covering synthetic and natural collision datasets, and also online robotic tests. The experimental results show that the F-LGMD, with a unified network, can fulfil the diverse collision selectivity revealed in physiology, which not only reduces considerably the handcrafted parameters compared to previous studies, but also offers a both efficient and robust scheme for collision perception through feedback neural computation.",,"Bio-inspired, Collision selectivity, LGMD, Feedback neural computation, ON/OFF channels"

Done properly, these models are able to provide a safe, quick, and cheap solution for this challenge. There are numerous types of mathematical models for epidemiological disease spread and control. However, in order to become applicative tools for decision-making, the modelers of these models are required to overcome three computational challenges: efficiently define the model, develop it as computer software, and fit it into historical data. Performed efficiently, one can use the obtained tool to explore possible scenarios and PIPs.

By intersecting the pre-clipped Voronoi cell with the tangent plane, this method directly calculates the RTF of each point without any auxiliary points or traversing Voronoi cells. Moreover, to restrict the movement of points, we introduce a projection method based on the KNN strategy, where each point is projected onto the triangular facet in the original surface. Owing to the independence and non-interference of the RTF computation and projection of each point, our method is implemented in parallel on the GPU. Experimental results on various mesh surfaces demonstrate the superior performance of our method in the viability, effectiveness, and efficiency.",,"Restricted tangent face, Centroidal Voronoi tessellation, Parallel computation, GPU acceleration, Surface remeshing"

Running parallel to this trend are advances in programming environments and teaching methods which aim to make computer science more accessible, and more motivating. In this paper, we describe the design and evaluation of Flip, a programming language that aims to help 11–15 year olds develop computational skills through creating their own 3D role-playing games. Flip has two main components: 1) a visual language (based on an interlocking blocks design common to many current visual languages), and 2) a dynamically updating natural language version of the script under creation. This programming-language/natural-language pairing is a unique feature of Flip, designed to allow learners to draw upon their familiarity with natural language to “decode the code”. Flip aims to support young people in developing an understanding of computational concepts as well as the skills to use and communicate these concepts effectively. This paper investigates the extent to which Flip can be used by young people to create working scripts, and examines improvements in their expression of computational rules and concepts after using the tool. We provide an overview of the design and implementation of Flip before describing an evaluation study carried out with 12–13 year olds in a naturalistic setting. Over the course of 8 weeks, the majority of students were able to use Flip to write small programs to bring about interactive behaviours in the games they created. Furthermore, there was a significant improvement in their computational communication after using Flip (as measured by a pre/post-test). An additional finding was that girls wrote more, and more complex, scripts than did boys, and there was a trend for girls to show greater learning gains relative to the boys.",,"Evaluation of CAL systems, Interactive learning environments, Programming and programming languages, Secondary education"

Liberman (1925–2011) can be considered as a founder of the new field of science that explores natural computation and its limits. He named it Chaimatics and suggested its generalization to the ultimate all-encompassing theory that unites biology, physics and mathematics. He made a number of experimental discoveries, including color coding in the retina, the participation mechanisms of Ca2+ ions in synaptic transmission, and the measurement of potential in the coupling membranes of mitochondria and chloroplasts. He also made a decisive contribution to the proof of the chemiosmotic hypothesis of oxidative phosphorylation. In a series of works started in 1972, Liberman developed the concept of the molecular computer of the cell, which includes the programs written on DNA and RNA nucleotide sequences and executed by enzymes playing the role of processing units whereas nucleotide sequences are interpreted as commands and addresses. In this framework, Liberman predicted RNA splicing before its discovery and suggested the role of processing of small informational molecules (later defined as small RNAs) in controlling biological processes. Efim Liberman defined the fundamental property of life as a molecular and quantum computational system and introduced the idea of quantum computing inside a cell for making decisions on complex control tasks described by equations of mathematical physics. He approached the brain as a net of molecular computers and created a model of neuron operation based on the transmission of hypersound signals via cytoskeleton where the molecular computational system encodes the digital output. In 1979 Liberman published a hypothesis of human self-consciousness associated with not a chemical, but with a physical quantum coherent system and named it “extremal quantum regulator”. We review here the contributions of Liberman in understanding the mechanisms of intracellular processing of information and his efforts to create an integrative theory of natural computation that aims to unite biology, physics and mathematics.",,"Efim Liberman, Quantum computation, Biological computation, Unity of science, Encoding, Genetic language, Natural algorithm, Molecular computer of the cell, Quantum regulator"

However, current formulation development still relies on traditional trial-and-error experiments, which are time-consuming, costly, and unpredictable. With the exponential growth of computing capability and algorithms, in recent ten years, a new discipline named “computational pharmaceutics” integrates with big data, artificial intelligence, and multi-scale modeling techniques into pharmaceutics, which offered great potential to shift the paradigm of drug delivery. Computational pharmaceutics can provide multi-scale lenses to pharmaceutical scientists, revealing physical, chemical, mathematical, and data-driven details ranging across pre-formulation studies, formulation screening, in vivo prediction in the human body, and precision medicine in the clinic.

Throughout the history of psychology, there has been an agreement that the essential features of a problem are that an organism has a goal but lacks a clear or well-learned route to the goal. Thus the emphasis in research on problem solving has been on response discovery—how the organism arrives at an effective, goal-attaining behavior. There have often been controversies over the role of learning or past experiences in problem solving. This chapter illustrates the conflict between emphases on learning and emphases on perception as central components of problem solving. Because a problem solver must find a solution, it might seem inevitable that an essential activity tries different approaches makes errors until the right approach is found. Earlier in problem-solving research, trial and error became associated with the view that acquiring a solution was a gradual, undirected process that did not involve perception or comprehension of problem requirements or structure.",Academic Press,

Driven by the ambition to untangle data-driven urbanism from HCS, this paper reviews two decades of scholarship that has used digital traces as an empirical ground for understanding urban phenomena. The review identifies four distinct ways of working with digital traces of which three pave the way for new ways of problematizing the city. Instead of abandoning the idea of data-driven urbanism, we propose the framework of 'soft city sensing' (SCS) as way to re-engage with it with inspiration from these pioneering works. However, this requires a willingness to revisit central epistemological commitments that currently serve as standards for how to “properly” do data projects. We therefore urge qualitative urban scholars to ponder the possibilities of furthering their urban interest by ‘thinking with algorithms’ while retaining their interpretative ambitions just as we identify a need for urban decion-makers to expand their criteria for what serves as valid data inputs to urban planning.",,"Soft City Sensing, Urban studies, Big data, Social web, Digital city, Computational humanities"

Here curvature of the femoral component plays an important role in effective implant design. Therefore, the objective here is to investigate the influence of this curvature of the femoral component on the mechanical response of the bearing component. A 3D finite element knee implant model with a circular and an elliptical femoral component is developed and investigated for gait kinetics and kinematics. Responses such as contact pressure, stresses, strains, and wear produced on the tibial insert are estimated throughout the gait cycle. These findings suggest that the elliptical femoral component generates less contact pressure on the tibial insert than its circular counterpart. It is also inferred that too much variation in this curvature is not recommended as it may affect the patient's comfort level. In addition, the wear of the tibial insert is computed based on the contact pressure created by both knee implant models. Our study suggests an optimum value for the curvature and the comfort level of the patients over the existing knee implant designs.",,"Femoral component, Knee implant, Total knee replacement, Tibial insert, UHMWPE"

Starting from a critique of current dominant models of computation, and drawing on the philosophical notions of the virtual and the event, uncertainty, contingency and indeterminacy are proposed as virtualities that express the ongoing differentiation of digital matter. On these grounds, the glitch is reframed as an event capable of revealing the potential of the digital in processes of computational making. Ideas concerning the incomputable and non-human intelligence of the algorithm underpin this argument. Finally, it is proposed that intuitive and uncognitive modes of apprehending digital making operate as forms of divination that capture the unprogrammed unfolding of matter.",,"philosophy of design, computational models, digital design, design processes, uncertainty"

However, the instability of the wireless environment brings a lot of uncertainty to the computational offloading. Additionally, intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is considered as a potential technology to enhance Quality of Service (QoS). Therefore, in this paper, we establish a framework for IRS-assisted MEC computational offloading to solve this problem and take fairness optimization as a key point involving communication and computing resources. Minimize user consumption by optimizing bandwidth allocation, task offloading ratio, edge computing resources, transmission power and IRS phase shifts. Firstly, we decompose the problem into three aspects, such as bandwidth allocation, computing resource allocation, transmission power and IRS phase shifts. Then, an alternative optimization algorithm is proposed to find the optimum solution and its convergence is proved. Secondly, since the optimization problem on transmission power and IRS phase shifts is non-convex, we propose Riemann gradient descent (R-SGD) algorithm to solve it. Finally, numerical results show that our proposed algorithm performs better than other algorithms and achieves a superiority in the framework.",,"MEC, Computational offloading, IRS, Convex optimization, Fairness"

These two related disciplines have been accused of a conceptual error so profound that their very existence is jeopardized. Sometimes, however, philosophers successfully arrest and lock up the guilty. The best example of this, ironically, is in psychology. Artificial intelligence and computational cognitive science are both committed to the claim that computers can think. The former is committed to the claim that human-made computers can think, while computational cognitive science is committed to the view that naturally occurring computers, brains, think. AI is the field dedicated to building intelligent computers. AI ultimately wants a machine that could solve very difficult, novel problems like proving Fermat's last theorem, correcting the greenhouse effect, or figuring out the fundamental structure of space-time. Historically, AI is associated with computer science, but the compleat AI researcher frequently knows a fair amount of psychology, linguistics, neuroscience, mathematics, and possibly some other discipline.",Academic Press,

This study aims to map how digital has been examined to date in rural-focused studies, and accordingly present propositions for how rural-digital studies can be sensitive to the distinctive and diverse character of rural spaces and places. We conduct a two-stage/scale literature review, combining 1) computational topic modelling from a Global Dataset (459 article abstracts) with 2) qualitative content analysis from a sub-dataset focusing on the Nordic region (Nordic Sub-Dataset, 17 full articles). We begin with a topic modelling analysis generating ten major themes (topics) leading to an overview of how research areas are connected to the meaning of rural context. Turning to the Nordic region, as an in-depth example, we illustrate the complexity of rural digital geographies, through a qualitative content analysis. This demonstrates that digital in rural contexts are primarily positioned outwardly as social/regional development and business/economy, and less situated inwardly through individual experience and community building. Combined we show a wide spectrum of rural-digital relations but demonstrate that rural contexts in rural-digital relations need more attention. We propose three propositions to invite deeper rural contextualizations in future digital studies to uphold the importance of rural spaces and places through, by and with digital geography.",,"Rural geography, Digital geography, Rural-digital relations, Context, Computational literature review, Topic modelling, Qualitative content analysis, Global, Nordic"

The interview assesses content from Number, Measurement and Geometry, in an interactive, hands-on format, with children's responses and strategies determining the path through the interview protocol. Follow-up discussion in class enabled preservice teachers to explore appropriate pedagogies that build upon what had been learned from the interviews. The research described in this chapter sought to investigate the effectiveness of this process. Interviews and written questionnaires were the data sources.

That allowed evaluation of new games not yet played and later led to a more abstract conception of probability as a measure satisfying certain conditions (‘axioms’). Only in the past 150 years or so has probability had a major role in science and only in the last 50 years or so in everyday life—as for example in evaluating medical outcomes or technological risks or manufacturer liability. Thus, especially in attempting to assess probability in everyday situations, our intuitions are often deficient—more so than those concerning quantity, space, and time. The major problem is not, however, one of making random errors in probability judgments but of making systematic ones that result from a number of well-known and research systematic cognitive biases and heuristics, which are described in this article. These systematic departures from rational assessment do not imply that coherent and accurate probabilistic thinking is (anywhere near) impossible, but that when departures from coherence and accuracy occur, they tend to follow a predictable pattern.",Pergamon,

With these merits there has been an emerging field of computational psychiatry and here we review specific studies that focused on MDD. Considerable evidence suggests that MDD is associated with impaired brain signals of reward prediction error and expected value (‘wanting’), decreased reward sensitivity (‘liking’) and/or learning (be it model-free or model-based), etc., although the causality remains unclear. These parameters may serve as valuable intermediate phenotypes of MDD, linking general clinical symptoms to underlying molecular dysfunctions.

One potential approach to mitigating this complexity is incorporating creative cognition into the evolving artificial intelligence systems and associated neural models. Hopfield neural network (HNN) are commonly acknowledged as a simplified neural model, renowned for their biological plausibility to store and retrieve information, specifically patterns of neurons. Our findings suggest utilizing modern HNN to emulate creative thinking by making meaningful associations between seemingly disparate concepts. This semantic link is represented as a radio knob that can be set to determine whether the network solves problems creatively or shuts down; the threshold is a parameter. We used the term ""first knob of creativity"" to describe a certain pattern and utilized the ""second knob of creativity"" to aid in the examination of alternatives within the network. By manipulating the knobs, it is possible to selectively suppress specific patterns, facilitating the creative functioning of the HNN and identifying other patterns with which input can be linked.",,"Creative Thinking, Hopfield Neural Network, Patterns, Memory, Associative Chains, Semantic Association"

This apparent decline in class closure contrasts sharply with rising inequality and declining economic mobility. How are these competing developments reflected in everyday class distinction-making? In this article, we answer this question by applying Goffman's work on the symbols of class status to the analysis of unique data: a corpus of etiquette books published between 1922 and 2017. We use word embeddings to quantify the salience of six class concepts (affluence, cultivation, education, employment, morality, and status) in the corpus. We find that education and employment are increasingly salient while status, affluence, cultivation, and morality decline in their salience to class distinction-making. These results signal a decline of class operating as a status group through cultural closure, the rise of education and employment as the carriers of class in everyday life, and the corresponding legitimation of class position and class inequality based on supposedly meritocratic grounds.

Antibiotic-associated diarrhea, pseudomembranous colitis, and toxic megacolon are the most common forms of C. difficile infection (CDI). Considering the high antibiotic resistance of C. difficile isolates and the low efficacy of immunization with toxin-related vaccines, we suggested that surface-exposed and secreted proteins could be considered as potential immunogenic targets against CDI. Various immuninformatics databases were used to predict antigenicity, allergenicity, B-cell epitopes, MHC-II binding sites, conserved domains, prevalence and conservation of proteins among the most common sequence types, molecular docking, and immunosimulation of immunogenic targets. Finally, 16 proteins belonging to three functional groups were identified, including proteins involved in the cell wall and peptidoglycan layer (nine proteins), flagellar assembly (five proteins), spore germination (one protein), and a protein with unknown function. Molecular docking results showed that among all the mentioned proteins, WP_009892971.1 (Acd) and WP_009890599.1 (a C40 family peptidase) had the strongest interactions with human Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR-2) and TLR-4.

However, to the extent that RSA plays a role in the efficiency of gas exchange, it may be expected to correlate better with HR/f (‘breathing specific heart rate’) than with f, because the former is a better reflection of the cardio-respiratory coupling. We measured RSA breath-by-breath in 209 young men and women during spontaneous breathing and during volitional breathing under auditory cues at vastly different f. In either case, and for both genders, RSA correlated better with HR/f than with f. As HR/f increased so did RSA, in a linear manner. When compared on the basis of HR/f, RSA did not differ significantly between spontaneous and volitional breathing.

The framework yields a theoretical conception of strength of inference, that is, a theory of what the strength of an inference is objectively: it equals the proportion of possible states of affairs consistent with the premises in which the conclusion is true, that is, the probability that the conclusion is true given that the premises are true. Since there are infinitely many possible states of affairs consistent with any set of premises, the paper then characterizes how individuals estimate the strength of an argument. They construct mental models, which each correspond to an infinite set of possibilities (or, in some cases, a finite set of infinite sets of possibilities).

Participants included 108 first-year undergraduate students majoring in humanities and social sciences at a South Korean university. The study found a significant relationship between group cohesiveness and CPS skill levels across various CPS phases. Specifically, substantial differences in SSMR patterns, particularly concerning exploration and evaluation, were observed among low- and high-creativity groups. These findings suggest that the interplay of divergent and convergent thinking during CPS is crucial for devising novel and practical solutions.

Methods Behavioral data was collected across 99 sessions from 38 participants recruited from an inpatient psychiatric unit. Each session started with a semi-structured interview modeled on a typical “clinical rounds” encounter and included administration of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Analysis We quantified aspects of participants' verbal behavior during the interview using lexical, coherence, and disfluency features. We then used two complementary approaches to explore our second objective. The first approach used predictive models to estimate participants' PANSS scores from their language features. Our second approach used inferential models to quantify the relationships between individual language features and symptom measures. Results Our predictive models showed promise but lacked sufficient data to achieve clinically useful accuracy. Our inferential models identified statistically significant relationships between numerous language features and symptom domains. Conclusion Our interview recording procedures were well-tolerated and produced adequate data for transcription and analysis. The results of our inferential modeling suggest that automatic measurements of expressive language contain signals highly relevant to the assessment of psychosis. These findings establish the potential of measuring language during a clinical interview in a naturalistic setting and generate specific hypotheses that can be tested in future studies. This, in turn, will lead to more accurate modeling and better understanding of the relationships between expressive language and psychosis.",,"Language, Schizophrenia, Bipolar disorder, Positive symptoms, Negative symptoms"

Thus, human beings still carry out the vast majority of creative process-related functions for AI. Moreover, most human creativity is embodied and involves the manipulation of tools and materials. Furthermore, all human creativity is based on “tagging” information and experiences through perceptions, sensations and emotions with meanings or actions. No AI has these attributes. All human innovations also involve “untagging” preconceived meanings and actions so as to “retag” them in novel and effective ways that change how we feel, understand and act. No AI can untag or retag data, let alone act.

ABSTRACT Human milk is a complex and dynamic biological system that has evolved to optimally nourish and protect human infants. Yet, according to a recent priority-setting review, “our current understanding of human milk composition and its individual components and their functions fails to fully recognize the importance of the chronobiology and systems biology of human milk in the context of milk synthesis, optimal timing and duration of feeding, and period of lactation” (P.

(i) Studies have typically examined each subsystem of the mother-milk-infant “triad” in isolation and often focus on a single element or component (e.g., maternal lactation physiology or milk microbiome or milk oligosaccharides or infant microbiome or infant gut physiology). This undermines our ability to develop comprehensive representations of the interactions between these elements and study their response to external perturbations. (ii) Multiomics studies are often cross-sectional, presenting a snapshot of milk composition, largely ignoring the temporal variability during lactation. The lack of temporal resolution precludes the characterization and inference of robust interactions between the dynamic subsystems of the triad. (iii) We lack computational methods to represent and decipher the complex ecosystem of the mother-milk-infant triad and its environment. In this review, we advocate for longitudinal multiomics data collection and demonstrate how incorporating knowledge gleaned from microbial community ecology and computational methods developed for microbiome research can serve as an anchor to advance the study of human milk and its many components as a “system within a system.”",,"computational methods, human microbiome, human milk, chronobiology, community ecology theory, system biology, lactation, breastfeeding"

As climate change impacts become more noticeable and costlier, some current water management strategies will not be useful. According to the findings of CIRCE, the areas with limited water resources will increase in the coming decades with major consequences for the way we produce food and we protect ecosystems. Based on these projections this paper discusses water policy priorities for climate change adaptation in the Mediterranean. We first summarise the main challenges to water resources in Mediterranean countries and outline the risks and opportunities for water under climate change based on previous studies. Recognising the difficulty to go from precipitation to water policy, we then present a framework to evaluate water availability in response to natural and management conditions, with an example of application in the Ebro basin that exemplifies other Mediterranean areas. Then we evaluate adaptive capacity to understand the ability of Mediterranean countries to face, respond and recover from climate change impacts on water resources. Social and economic factors are key drivers of inequality in the adaptive capacity across the region. Based on the assessment of impacts and adaptive capacity we suggest thresholds for water policy to respond to climate change and link water scarcity indicators to relevant potential adaptation strategies. Our results suggest the need to further prioritise socially and economically sensitive policies.",,"Mediterranean, Climate change, Water policy, Adaptation and assessment"

Deep learning has been extensively investigated and utilized in the area of medical assistance diagnosis in recent decades due to its outstanding performance and objective prediction. However, a huge semantic chasm dividing clinicians and unexplainable deep models emerges. Here we design a brain-inspired inference framework from medical images to explainable features, then to the final diagnostic conclusions. The fast thinking module is responsible for recognizing medical features in ultrasound (US) images, and the slow-thinking module builds a model for inferring from medical features to diagnostic results by constructing a knowledge graph of medical features with tensor decomposition. The whole model infers through intuition and thinking like a human being, and gives the recognized medical image features while inferring the diagnosis, which greatly improves the interpretability of the model. We conducted studies on thyroid cancer diagnoses using US images. The American College of Radiology (ACR) Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (TI-RADS) characteristics are employed as medical features describing thyroid nodules. Our brain-inspired medical inference framework outperforms commonly used deep learning algorithms, with an AUC score of 0.963 (95% confidential interval (CI)=0.923–1.000) for thyroid US image diagnosis.

Apnoeic oxygenation extends safe apnoea time, reducing risk during airway management. We hypothesised that low-flow nasal oxygenation (LFNO) would extend safe apnoea time similarly to high-flow nasal oxygenation (HFNO), whilst allowing face-mask preoxygenation and rescue. Methods A high-fidelity, computational, physiological model was used to examine the progression of hypoxaemia during apnoea in virtual models of pregnant women in and out of labour, with BMI of 24–50 kg m−2. Subjects were preoxygenated with oxygen 100% to reach end-tidal oxygen fraction (FE'O2) of 60%, 70%, 80%, or 90%. When apnoea started, HFNO or LFNO was commenced. To simulate varying degrees of effectiveness of LFNO, periglottic oxygen fraction (FgO2) of 21%, 60%, or 100% was configured. HFNO provided FgO2 100% and oscillating positive pharyngeal pressure. Results Application of LFNO (FgO2 100%) after optimal preoxygenation (FE'O2 90%) resulted in similar or longer safe apnoea times than HFNO FE'O2 80% in all subjects in labour. For BMI of 24, the time to reach SaO2 90% with LFNO was 25.4 min (FE'O2 90%/FgO2 100%) vs 25.4 min with HFNO (FE'O2 80%). For BMI of 50, the time was 9.9 min with LFNO (FE'O2 90%/FgO2 100%) vs 4.3 min with HFNO (FE'O2 80%). A similar finding was seen in subjects with BMI ≥40 kg m−2 not in labour. Conclusions There is likely to be clinical benefit to using LFNO, given that LFNO and HFNO extend safe apnoea time similarly, particularly when BMI ≥40 kg m−2.

Six individuals with a diagnosis of schizophrenia were identified in the Copenhagen High-Risk study and each pedigree was centered on one of the six original schizophrenic probands' nuclear families. The 329 pedigree members in the study were considered at risk for schizophrenia spectrum disorders because most were genetically related to the originating schizophrenic probands. The participants were administered the Copenhagen Interview of Functional Illness to determine diagnoses and the Thought Disorder Index (TDI) was used to assess FTD. Individuals with a schizophrenia diagnosis had higher global levels of FTD, exhibited more severe types of FTD, and had a qualitatively different type of FTD than did participants with other diagnoses or no mental illness. Individuals with Cluster A diagnoses exhibited more FTD and FTD similar in quality to participants with schizophrenia. These results support the construct of a spectrum of schizophrenia conditions.

For this purpose, we exploit the geometry of the rfMRI signal space to propose a novel orthogonal transformation that synchronizes rfMRI time-series across sessions and subjects. When synchronized, rfMRI signals become approximately equal at homologous locations across subjects. The method is based on the observation that rfMRI data exhibit similar connectivity patterns across subjects, as reflected in the pairwise correlations between different brain regions. We show that if the data for two subjects have similar correlation patterns then their time courses can be approximately synchronized by an orthogonal transformation. This transform is unique, invertible, efficient to compute, and preserves the connectivity structure of the original data for all subjects. Analogously to image registration, where we spatially align structural brain images, this temporal synchronization of brain signals across a population, or within-subject across sessions, facilitates cross-sectional and longitudinal studies of rfMRI data. The utility of the BrainSync transform is illustrated through demonstrative simulations and applications including quantification of rfMRI variability across subjects and sessions, cortical functional parcellation across a population, timing recovery in task fMRI data, comparison of task and resting state data, and an application to complex naturalistic stimuli for annotation prediction.",,

Recently, we observed higher semantic similarity in first-episode-schizophrenia (FES) patients. In this study, we investigate if this aberrant similarity relates to the ‘causal’ connectivity between two key nodes of the word production system: inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and the semantic-hub at the ventral anterior temporal lobe (vATL). Methods Resting-state fMRI scans were collected from 60 participants (30 untreated FES and 30 healthy controls). The semantic distance was measured with the CoVec semantic tool based on GloVe. A spectral dynamic causal model with Parametrical Empirical Bayes was constructed modelling the intrinsic self-inhibitory and extrinsic-excitatory connections within the brain regions. We estimated the parameters of a fully connected model with the semantic distance as a covariate. Results FES patients chose words with higher semantic similarity when describing the pictures compared to the HC group. Among patients, an increased semantic similarity was related with an increase in intrinsic connections within both the vATL and IFG, suggesting that reduced ‘synaptic gain’ in these regions likely contribute to aberrant sampling of the semantic space during discourse in schizophrenia. Conclusions Lexical impoverishment relates to increased self-inhibition in both the IFG and vATL. The associated reduction in synaptic gain may relate to reduced precision of locally generated neural activity, forcing the choice of words that are already ‘activated’ in a lexical network. One approach to improve word sampling may be via promoting synaptic gain via supra-physiological stimulation within the Broca's-vATL network; this proposal needs verification.",,"Psychosis, Lexical access, fMRI, Spectral dynamic causal modelling, Broca's area, Disorganization, Formal thought disorder"

These problems also present the opportunity to discuss the use of expert knowledge as an important constituent of uncertainty quantification. More specifically, how do the principles and methods of eliciting and analyzing expert knowledge apply to these problems and similar ones encountered in complex technical problem solving and decision making? We will address this question, demonstrating how the elicitation issues and the knowledge that experts provide can be used to assess the uncertainty in outputs that emerge from a black box model or computational code represented by the challenge problems. In our experience, the rich collection of GITs provides an opportunity to capture the experts' knowledge and associated uncertainties consistent with their thinking, problem solving, and problem representation. The elicitation process is rightly treated as part of an overall analytical approach, and the information elicited is not simply a source of data. In this paper, we detail how the elicitation process itself impacts the analyst's ability to represent, aggregate, and propagate uncertainty, as well as how to interpret uncertainties in outputs. While this approach does not advocate a specific GIT, answers under uncertainty do result from the elicitation.",,"Expert judgment, Elicitation, Probability theory, Epistemic uncertainty"

The prevalence of this view is the result of long and intense study of nerve impulses in electrophysiology culminating in the introduction of the Hodgkin-Huxley model of the action potential in the 1950s. To this day, this model forms the physiological foundation for a broad area of neuroscientific research. However, the Hodgkin-Huxley model cannot account for non-electrical phenomena that accompany nerve impulse propagation, for which there is nevertheless ample evidence. This raises the question whether the Hodgkin-Huxley model is a complete model of the nerve impulse. Several alternative models have been proposed that do take into account non-electrical aspects of the nerve impulse and emphasize their importance in gaining a more complete understanding of the nature of the nerve impulse. In our opinion, these models deserve more attention in neuroscientific research, since, together with the Hodgkin-Huxley model, they will help in addressing and solving a number of questions in basic and applied neuroscience which thus far have remained outside our grasp. Here we provide a historico-scientific overview of the developments that have led to the current conception of the action potential as an electrical phenomenon, discuss some major objections against this conception, and suggest a number of scientific factors which have likely contributed to the enduring success of the Hodgkin-Huxley model and should be taken into consideration whilst contemplating the formulation of a more extensive and complete conception of the nerve impulse.",,"Nerve impulse, Action potential, Electromechanical pulse, Signal propagation, Hodgkin-Huxley model, Neuroscientific models"

Drawing on a lexical approach to personality, the most commonly-used adjectives within narratives written by college students were identified using computerized text analytic tools. A factor analysis on the use of these adjectives in the self-descriptions produced a 7-factor solution consisting of psychologically meaningful dimensions. Some dimensions were unipolar (e.g., Negativity factor, wherein most loaded items were negatively valenced adjectives); others were dimensional in that semantically opposite words clustered together (e.g., Sociability factor, wherein terms such as shy, outgoing, reserved, and loud all loaded in the same direction). The factors exhibited modest reliability across different types of writing samples and were correlated with self-reports and behaviors consistent with the dimensions. Similar analyses with additional content words (adjectives, adverbs, nouns, and verbs) yielded additional psychological dimensions associated with physical appearance, school, relationships, etc. in which people contextualize their self-concepts. The results suggest that the meaning extraction method is a promising strategy that determines the dimensions along which people think about themselves.",,"LIWC, Meaning extraction method, Natural language, Self-descriptions"

In recent years, many cognitive models have focused on dual process theories to better describe and implement complex cognitive skills in artificial agents, but creativity has been approached only at a descriptive level. In previous works we have described various modules of the cognitive architecture that allows a robot to execute creative paintings. By means of dual process theories we refine some relevant mechanisms to obtain artworks, and in particular we explain details about resolution level of the CA dealing with different strategies of access to the Long Term Memory (LTM) and managing the interaction between S1 and S2 processes of the dual process theory. The creative process involves both divergent and convergent processes in either implicit or explicit manner. This leads to four activities (exploratory, reflective, tacit, and analytic) that, triggered by urges and motivations, generate creative acts. These creative acts exploit both the LTM and the WM in order to make novel substitutions to a perceived image by properly mixing parts of pictures coming from different domains. The paper highlights the role of the interaction between S1 and S2 processes, modulated by the resolution level which focuses the attention of the creative agent by broadening or narrowing the exploration of novel solutions, or even drawing the solution from a set of already made associations. An example of artificial painter is described in some experimentations by using a robotic platform.",,"Computational creativity, Cognitive architecture, Dual process theory, PSI model"

However, integrating these core elements of computer science knowledge might not meet the observed need that students will benefit from gaining practical experience with AI in the direct application area. Therefore, this paper proposes a dynamic approach to case-based learning that utilizes the scenarios where AI is currently used in clinical practice as examples. This approach will support students' understanding of technical aspects. Case-based learning with AI as an example provides additional benefits: (1) it allows doctors to compare their thought processes to the AI suggestions and critically reflect on the assumptions and biases of AI and clinical practice; (2) it incentivizes doctors to discuss and address ethical issues inherent to technology and those already existing in current clinical practice; (3) it serves as a foundation for fostering interdisciplinary collaboration via discussion of different views between technologists, multidisciplinary experts, and healthcare professionals. The proposed knowledge shift from AI as a technical focus to AI as an example for case-based learning aims to encourage a different perspective on educational needs.

The rapid technological advancement over the past decade has fueled an enormous demand for the integration of modern networking, informational and computational tools with classical pedagogical instruments. Consequently, teaching with technology typically involves utilizing a variety of IT and multimedia resources for online learning, course management, electronic course materials, and novel tools of communication, engagement, experimental, critical thinking, and assessment. The NSF-funded Statistics Online Computational Resource (SOCR) provides a number of interactive tools for enhancing instruction in various undergraduate and graduate courses in probability and statistics. These resources include online instructional materials, statistical calculators, interactive graphical user interfaces, computational and simulation applets, tools for data analysis and visualization. The tools provided as part of SOCR include conceptual simulations and statistical computing interfaces, which are designed to bridge between the introductory and the more advanced computational and applied probability and statistics courses. In this manuscript, we describe our designs for utilizing SOCR technology in instruction in a recent study. In addition, present the results of the effectiveness of using SOCR tools at two different course intensity levels on three outcome measures: exam scores, student satisfaction and choice of technology to complete assignments. Learning styles assessment was completed at baseline. We have used three very different designs for three different undergraduate classes. Each course included a treatment group, using the SOCR resources, and a control group, using classical instruction techniques. Our findings include marginal effects of the SOCR treatment per individual classes; however, pooling the results across all courses and sections, SOCR effects on the treatment groups were exceptionally robust and significant. Coupling these findings with a clear decrease in the variance of the quantitative examination measures in the treatment groups indicates that employing technology, like SOCR, in a sound pedagogical and scientific manner enhances overall the students’ understanding and suggests better long-term knowledge retention.",,"Education research, Teaching with technology, Java applets, Online course materials, Probability and statistics"

Then, it introduces the data sources and modeling strategies that climate science uses to understand past behavior, to fingerprint causes of current climate changes, and to project future climate. The complex dynamics of the climate system constrain ability to gain knowledge about the climate system and add uncertainty to predictions of the impacts of human-induced climate change. It also investigates six case studies that illustrate the importance and development of key complexity themes in climate science: glacial-interglacial cycles, thermohaline ocean circulation, ice sheets, vegetation cover changes, extinction, and overshoot scenarios. In addition, it investigates the implications of the complexity of the Earth system for climate policy analysis. Assessments of the impacts of climate change are often disciplinary-based and not sufficiently integrative across important disciplinary subcomponents, producing misleading results that have potentially dangerous environmental consequences.

Organizations which derive their structure, strategy and motivation from the singleness of purpose will not and can not be conducive to the notions of multiple critera, no matter how skillfully or forcefully presented, or mathematically complete and computationally user-friendly. The organization, its structure and motivational culture have to change first. In short, traditional hierarchy of command, based on extreme specialization and little autonomy of employees and their departments will not be as open to the multiplicity of criteria as the self-managing teams of non-hierarchical companies which integrate task, labor and knowledge and which are only now starting to dominate certain business and management cultures.",,

Where individuals have a wider range of decisions to influence, the consequence of decisions far more propagate across the system, and the business environment continually influences the status of the system. Predicting the cascading effects of decisions in such situations would be very problematic yet can have several implications for managers and executives to think beyond organizational silos and make local decision with a bigger picture of emergent consequences in mind. A prominent challenge within this realm is the ever-increasing complexity of decision propagations, especially when incorporating the role and influence of people involved in decision-making. This paper tackles this challenge from an engineering change perspective, with the focus on computing the compound risk of decisions when their consequences concurrently propagate across the system. We introduce an interactive tool called Virtual Net Propagator, which incorporates organizational dynamics into decision analysis, with the aim to identify change opportunities and effective set of interventions. Illustrated by a field engineering case study, it is demonstrated that the proposed tool can provide detailed knowledge on how decisions are interconnected and how systemic (cascading) effects of a decision propagate through causal pathways, so highlighting key influencers along with role and influence of interfacing (hidden) players.",,"Change propagation, Complex networks, Computational intelligence, Systems design and analysis, Socio-technical systems, Web-based decision support system"

However, many existing feature extraction methods in remote sensing are unable to exhibit multiple-instance nonlinear spatial pattern recognition at scales via ensemble learning. This paper designed for lake algal bloom monitoring presents intelligent feature extraction for harmonizing local and global features via tensor flow-based ensemble learning with integrated biomimetic and computational intelligence. To explore such complexity, an Integrated Biomimetic and Ensemble Learning Algorithm (IBELA) was developed to synthesize the contribution from different classifiers associated with the biomimetic philosophy of integrated bands. It leads to strengthened multiple-instance spatial pattern recognition in lake algal bloom monitoring via image fusion at the decision level. With the implementation of IBELA, a case study of a eutrophic freshwater lake, Lake Managua, for water quality monitoring leads to demonstrate six input visual senses showing different impacts on retrieving Chl-a concentrations in the dry and wet season, respectively. The input of total nitrogen from the watershed plays the most important role in water quality variations in both seasons in a watershed-based food–water nexus. Although ultraviolet and microwave bands are important in the dry season, Secchi disk depth is critical in the wet season for water quality monitoring.",,"Eutrophication, Biomimetic intelligence, Computational intelligence, Ensemble learning, Food-water nexus, Decision level fusion, Water quality monitoring"

The enormous impact that electronic computers have had on our lives is well known. If one could combine the speed of the present computer with the ability of the brain to think using families of symmetry patterns developing in space and time, a whole new era would be here. Moreover, cortical columns are organized in a very highly structured manner to form a cortical area. It is this higher-level architecture that has been examined in order to explore the further consequences of the concepts concerning computation by symmetry operations. It is suggested that a hardware analog-digital implementation of this higher-level cortical area architecture of trion cortical columns should be “straightforward” owing to the localized and structured connectivity, and the discreteness of the firing levels. It is noted that, high-speed parallel computations would allow one to look for symmetry operations in a cortical area.",Academic Press,

Event-related potentials and reaction times were measured across groups with varying DT (N = 40, 27.35 ± 5.05 years) and CT levels (N = 40, 27.88 ± 4.95 years). Based on the role of striatal dopamine in supporting cognitive flexibility, which facilitates DT, and considering the significance of phasic dopamine activity as the gate opening signal originating from the basal ganglia, we assumed that the gate opening process may contribute differently to DT and CT. Despite the absence of behavioural differences in gate opening costs, distinct neural patterns emerged. In the early time windows (P1, N1), gate opening effects were detected in both DT and CT groups, with a notable interaction influenced by the level of DT, resulting in significant effects within the lower DT group. The P2 component showed a gate opening effect only in the higher DT group. In the P3 time window, the process unfolded comparably in all groups. Our results suggest that groups with different levels of convergent thinking (based on Matrix reasoning) and those with lower DT (based on Creativity Index) tend to select and activate the prefrontal cortex representation containing the required task information at an earlier stage, compared to those with better DT. This could be beneficial especially in the early phase of idea generation, as more elements become available to create associations and original ideas.",,"Divergent/convergent thinking, Working memory, Reference-back paradigm, Gate opening, ERP"

While qualitative methods, taking advantage of the human cognitive system, have a great potential in addressing a wide range of problems in futures studies, this potential is mostly due to the human visual logic that can handle the task of imagining future scenarios much better than mathematical logic. On the other hand, computational methods benefit from the advantages of silicon-based systems namely speed, large memory, rapid networking, and communication. Hence, it would be extremely beneficial to come up with a solution that combines the positive sides of both qualitative and computational approaches. Cognitive artificial agents are computational units that make use of the human cognitive system. Their interaction with foresight and futures researchers can result in promising solutions for the problems addressed in futures studies.

This kind of systems are today the most utilized industrial plant for outdoor algae cultivation. The problem has been addressed combining theoretical correlations and experimental data. Head losses for conventional raceway ponds were evaluated, and the results were compared with data available in literature. Computational fluid dynamics was used to support the theoretical analysis. This study suggested possible improvements to the traditional RWP design: an Innovative Raceway Pond (IRP II) was therefore designed, built and operated in parallel with a reference pilot RWP in a test site. Several modifications to traditional RWP design were implemented in the IRP II: the paddle wheel was substituted by a propeller, the water head was reduced and baffle boards were installed in the curves. To validate the new design, head losses and therefore energy consumption in the different systems were evaluated, during cultivation experiments, with two microalgae strains. The theoretical and experimental study allowed a validated calculation, which showed the importance of concentrated head losses towards distributed ones. The analysis highlighted how these losses weight at different pond scales, suggesting possible improvements of the RWP energy performance – as achieved in the IRP II – through revised design for optimized mixing.",,"Microalgae, Biofuel, Raceway ponds, Head losses, Energy, Mixing"

Factors provide a lower-dimensional description with the aim of shedding light on network computations. Yet, mechanistically, computations are performed not by continuously valued factors but by interactions among neurons that spike discretely and variably. Models provide a means of bridging these levels of description. We developed a general method for training model networks of spiking neurons by leveraging factors extracted from either data or firing-rate-based networks. In addition to providing a useful model-building framework, this formalism illustrates how reliable and continuously valued factors can arise from seemingly stochastic spiking. Our framework establishes procedures for embedding this property in network models with different levels of realism. The relationship between spikes and factors in such networks provides a foundation for interpreting (and subtly redefining) commonly used quantities such as firing rates.",,"artificial neural networks, factor models, population dynamics, dimensionality reduction, spiking networks, recurrent neural networks, network training, FORCE learning, motor system, dynamical systems"

Objective measures like the verbal fluency test are often used to determine language dysfunction. Recent applications of computational approaches broaden insights into language-related functions. In addition, individuals diagnosed with a psychiatric or neurological disorder also often report subjective difficulties in language-related functions. Therefore, we investigated the association between objective and subjective measures of language functioning, on the one hand, and inter-individual structural variations in language-related brain areas, on the other hand. We performed a Latent Semantic analysis (LSA) on a semantic verbal fluency task in 101 healthy adult participants. To investigate if these objective measures are associated with a subjective one, we examined assessed subjective natural tendency of interest in language-related activity with a study-specific questionnaire. Lastly, a voxel-based brain morphometry (VBM) was conducted to reveal associations between objective (LSA) measures and structural changes in language-related brain areas. We found a positive correlation between the LSA measure cosine similarity and the subjective interest in language. Furthermore, we found that higher cosine similarity corresponds to higher gray matter volume in the right cerebellum. The results suggest that people with higher interests in language access semantic knowledge in a more organized way exhibited by higher cosine similarity and have larger gray matter volume in the right cerebellum, when compared to people with lower interests. In conclusion, we demonstrate that there is inter-individual diverseness of accessing the semantic knowledge space and that it is associated with subjective language interests as well as structural differences in the right cerebellum.",,"Language, SyNoPsis, Computational analysis, LSA, VBM, Healthy cohort, Psychosis"

The theory is derived from a recurring theme found in a diverse range of scientific change, scientific discovery, and knowledge diffusion theories in philosophy of science, sociology of science, social network analysis, and information science. The theory extends the concept of structural holes from social networks to a broader range of associative networks found in science studies, especially including networks that reflect underlying intellectual structures such as co-citation networks and collaboration networks. The central premise is that connecting otherwise disparate patches of knowledge is a valuable mechanism of creative thinking in general and transformative scientific discovery in particular. In addition, the premise consistently explains the value of connecting people from different disciplinary specialties. The theory not only explains the nature of transformative discoveries in terms of the brokerage mechanism but also characterizes the subsequent diffusion process as optimal information foraging in a problem space. Complementary to epidemiological models of diffusion, foraging-based conceptualizations offer a unified framework for arriving at insightful discoveries and optimizing subsequent pathways of search in a problem space. Structural and temporal properties of potentially high-impact scientific discoveries are derived from the theory to characterize the emergence and evolution of intellectual networks of a field. Two Nobel Prize winning discoveries, the discovery of Helicobacter pylori and gene targeting techniques, and a discovery in string theory demonstrated such properties. Connections to and differences from existing approaches are discussed. The primary value of the theory is that it provides not only a computational model of intellectual growth, but also concrete and constructive explanations of where one may find insightful inspirations for transformative scientific discoveries.",,"Theory of scientific discovery, Transformative scientific discoveries, Theory of structural holes, Intellectual brokerage, Knowledge diffusion, Information foraging"

The main features of both catalysts and ligand in directing the stereoselective outcome have been extensively studied in several papers mainly through 1H NMR and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques. However, over the years, no computational studies have been reported to support the models proposed to rationalize the observed stereoselectivity for the reaction between 3-acryloyl-1,3-oxazolidin-2-one and cyclopentadiene catalyzed by the BOX ligand (R,R)-(+)-2,2′-isopropylidenebis­(4-phenyl-2-oxazoline) and Mg­(II) salts. To approach the problem, we performed a density functional theory (DFT) computational study, aiming to locate the preferred transitions states deriving from these proposed models, but we only found a correspondence in selectivities for the reaction catalyzed by Mg­(OTf)2, where the model suggests an octahedral complex with the two triflate anions coordinating magnesium. For the other cases [i.e., Mg­(ClO4)2, Mg­(ClO4)2·2H2O, and MgI2·I2], the commonly accepted tetrahedral or octahedral models suggest no involvement of the perchlorate or iodide anions, but the corresponding calculations did not reproduce the experimental selectivities. Only when we considered also in these cases coordination complexes involving their presence, the observed selectivities were reproduced, thus opening new insights to better understand the role and the action of the counterion to determine the stereochemical outcome of these reactions.",,

Recent developments in strategy instruction research suggest that learning in a particular discipline is enhanced by guiding students through the development of content-relevant metacognitive strategies (Wosnitza & Volet, 2009).

The purpose of this study was to explore the impact of the Computational Experiment Methodology on learners' cognitive performance, use of modelling indicators and shift of the metacognitive experiences during problem solving using computational models. Sixty prospective primary school teachers volunteered to participate in the study. Students were exposed by the Instructor to a number of computational experiments, while during the course they developed their own models of simulation. The results of the experiment show that the use of the computational experiment approach has a substantial effect on the metacognitive experiences and the use of modelling indicators.",,"Metacognition, Modelling, Computational experiment, Inquiry based science education"

This traditional model may turn elementary-level lessons into an extremely theoretical, boring and non-effective process. In this context, research in mathematics elementary education in Mexico indicates the need to analyze alternative pedagogic practices and to find different ways to make mathematics education in early ages less difficult and more attractive. Constructivist theory can provide an alternative for developing pedagogic proposals. The objectives of this research were: (1) develop a computational platform to support the traditional Mexican method of education with practical mathematics problems simulated as part of the daily world environment and to increase the level of students' social involvement through direct collaboration, and (2) analyze how this computational tool affects student motivation, collaboration and discussion. An exploratory case study concerning dimensions of mathematics problem-solving using computer simulations was conducted with 6–8 year old elementary school children. After a theoretical class the children were involved in solving a series of verbal problems, using our computational platform. Sixty third-grade children participated in this case study and data were collected from their responses to questions and interviews in order to explore attitudes toward learning mathematics and assess self-efficacy in this area. The results obtained in this research indicate that the integration of computational tools into conventional method courses provides elements to improve student motivation, collaboration and discussion based on their own exploratory experiences. These results can assist other education programs to incorporate positive attitudes and their own knowledge creation from a constructivist approach using technology.",,"Elementary education, Constructivist theory, Interactive computational tools, Simulated environments, Process improvement"

In response to the evaluation and prediction problem of teaching games, a teaching game evaluation model based on improved sparrow search algorithm and back propagation neural network was studied and constructed. Firstly, a situational teaching game was designed and an evaluation index system was constructed. Then, a teaching game evaluation prediction model based on the improved method was established. Finally, the expert consultation method is adopted to collect opinions from experts in the field of education and construct an evaluation index system for teaching games. And based on the evaluation index system of teaching games, evaluate students’ mathematical thinking ability before and after experiencing teaching games to verify the application effect of teaching games. The scenario based teaching game designed in this study has a certain effect on improving students’ mathematical thinking ability. Students’ mathematical thinking has significantly improved (P<0.05), and the teaching effect is the same for students of different genders (P>0.1). The improved sparrow search algorithm has a faster convergence rate than other algorithms, and tends to be stable when iteration is about 100 when solving the single peak benchmark function. When solving the multimodal benchmark test function, it tends to stabilize when iteration is around 20. The teaching game evaluation prediction price model based on the improved method shows a trend of first increasing and then decreasing with hidden units increasing. When the hidden unit is 16, the area index under model curve is the highest, around 0.962, and its prediction accuracy is relatively high.

Specifically, we propose that behaviorally relevant information from bodies and body expressions is coded at the levels of midlevel features in the brain.

Specifically, where the goal is to help individuals develop their understanding of computation and/or use computation in real world settings, we question whether natural language might be a preferred notation to traditional programming languages, given its familiarity and ubiquity. We describe three empirical studies investigating the use of natural language for computation in which we found that although natural language provides support for understanding computational concepts, it introduces additional difficulties when used for coding. We distilled our findings into a set of design guidelines for novice programming environments which consider the ways in which different notations, including natural language, can best support the various activities that comprise programming. These guidelines were embodied in Flip, a bi-modal programming language used in conjunction with the Electron toolset, which allows young people to create their own commercial quality, narrative based role- playing games. Two empirical studies on the use of Flip in three different real world contexts considered the extent to which the design guidelines support ease of use and an understanding of computation. The guidelines have potential to be of use both in analysing the use of natural language in existing novice programming environments, and in the design of new ones.",,"Novice programming languages, Natural language, Design, Empirical evaluation"

The study examines the synergistic interaction between Human Intelligence (HI) and GAI across four group decision-making scenarios within three global organizations renowned for their cutting-edge operational techniques. The research progresses through several phases: identifying research problems, collecting baseline data on decision-making, implementing AI interventions, and evaluating the outcomes post-intervention to identify shifts in performance. The results demonstrate that GAI effectively reduces human cognitive burdens and mitigates heuristic biases by offering data-driven support and predictive analytics, grounded in System 2 reasoning. This is particularly valuable in complex situations characterized by unfamiliarity and information overload, where intuitive, System 1 thinking is less effective. However, the study also uncovers challenges related to GAI integration, such as potential over-reliance on technology, intrinsic biases particularly ‘out-of-the-box’ thinking without contextual creativity.

Text processing has always faced many challenges. The main one is the structural and semantic differences of sentences which have had a significant impact on the malfunction of auto-recognition systems. This problem becomes more prominent in short texts in which words and their concurrences are limited and insufficient. As a result of this, word frequency and TF-IDF weighing cannot well represent the relationship between words and the appropriate feature vector, leading to an undesirable accuracy of emotion recognition. Thus, different strategies should be applied to improve the feature vector and to formulate the features properly. The desired strategy should be able to identify the words that can distinguish between classes well and also to find the relationships between words and meaningful phrases using natural language processing concepts. In this paper, a combination of emotional models, categorical and hierarchical, are used for an emotional text recognition which could discover simultaneously explicit and implicit emotion in a short text. Our approach called DuFER, proposed a weighed method which improves the feature vector using language models and computational linguistics through applying a modified TF-IDF weighing to words as well as Maximum Likelihood Estimation weighing to expressions. Four implicit and explicit emotion datasets are used for the experiments. The results show that the accuracy of both implicit and explicit emotion recognition has increased and DuFER is actually the first successful dual framework in recognizing implicit and explicit emotions from text.",,"Sentiment analysis (SA), Opinion mining, Explicit emotion recognition (EER), Implicit emotion recognition (IER), Language model (LM), Feature weighing, Dual framework, Ensemble method, Computational linguistics, Machine learning"

However, understanding the pharmacology associated with M1-AChR activation or deactivation is complex, because of the low selectivity among muscarinic subtypes, hampering their therapeutic applications. In this regard, we constructed two quantitative structure–activity relationship (QSAR) models, one for M1-AChR agonists (total and partial), and the other for the antagonists. The binding mode of 59 structurally different compounds, including agonists and antagonists with experimental binding affinity values (pKi), were analyzed employing computational molecular docking over different structures of M1-AChR. Furthermore, we considered the interaction energy (Einter), the number of rotatable bonds (NRB), and lipophilicity (ilogP) for the construction of the QSAR model for agonists (R2 = 89.64, QLMO2 = 78, and Qext2 = 79.1).

Results indicated regionally increased neuronal signalling as a function of task complexity at frontal, temporal and parietal brain regions, although more robust task-related changes in EEG-indices of activation were derived over the left hemisphere.

Leveraging Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DeepL) on Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data offers enhanced insights, advancing the understanding and diagnostic capabilities of NDDs. Traditionally, researchers extract time series data from predefined brain regions (ROIs) using atlas-based methods and focus on generating brain functional connectivity using Pearson correlation by analyzing changes in signal amplitude over time. This conventional approach assumes that the brain’s structure can be modeled in a simple Euclidean space and predicted with conventional ML/DeepL techniques. However, these traditional methods have several drawbacks. Predefined ROI extraction fails to capture the inherent variability in brain connectivity patterns across individuals, potentially missing crucial information, while relying on Pearson correlation to analyze functional brain connectivity is sensitive to amplitude fluctuations caused by high neural oscillations, leading to inaccurate representations of true neural relationships. Modeling brain functional structure in Euclidean space does not account for the brain’s complex, non-linear neural dynamics, limiting the effectiveness of ML/DeepL models. To address these issues, we propose: 1) An approach that adapts ROIs for each subject using combined grouped Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and Dictionary Learning (DL), better representing individual brain topologies; 2) The application of Phase Locking Value (PLV) to estimate functional connectivity in the frequency domain, reducing sensitivity to amplitude variations while effectively capturing both linear and non-linear signal relationships; 3) The implementation of a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to address the brain’s non-Euclidean topological structure with graph architecture, enhancing the classification and diagnosis of neural disorders. This method was tested on the ADHD-200 dataset for ADHD and the ABIDE-I dataset for ASD, achieving high accuracy (94% ±1.3% for ADHD and 89.3% ±2.3% for ASD) through 10-fold cross-validation. The integration of data-driven ROI extraction, frequency-domain connectivity analysis, and non-Euclidean graph-based brain architecture representation collectively represents a novel approach to improving the understanding and prediction of NDDs.",,"Neurodevelopmental disorder, Brain functional connectivity, Functional magnetic resonance imaging(fMRI), Data-driven brain topology, Frequency specific connectivity, Graph convolutional networks"

In practice, an infinite run can be determined in finite time if it consists of a recurrent behavior with some finite prefix. Therefore, our study is restricted to such runs. We introduce the concept of d-diagram, which is a finite representation of infinite directed graphs. Given a d-diagram that represents an infinite distributed computation, we solve the problem of determining if a global predicate ever became true in the computation. The crucial aspect of this problem is the stopping rule that tells us when to conclude that the predicate can never become true in future. We also provide an algorithm to provide vector timestamps to events in the computation for determining the dependency relationship between any two events in the infinite run. Finally, we give an algorithm to compute a slice of a d-diagram which concisely captures all the consistent global states of the computation satisfying the given predicate.",,"Predicate detection, Liveness violation, d-Diagram, Recurrent computation"

Modelling, as a pedagogical tool, involves the model construction, the exploration of model characteristics and the model application to a specific problem, resembling authentic activities of scientists and mathematicians (Herbert, 2003). Jonassen and Strobel (2006) state that in addition to modelling domain knowledge, learners can apply modelling skills in different ways: by modelling domain knowledge, by modelling problems (constructing problem spaces), by modelling systems and by modelling semantic structures. The purpose of this study was to explore the effects of the Computational Experiment Mathematical Modelling (CEMM) approach on University students': a) reasoning abilities, b) learning performance, c) epistemological beliefs, and d) argumentation. Students worked in a learning environment which contained applications in Physics created by the author and all of them were based on mathematical models, as the model was considered as the fundamental unit of instruction (Hestenes, 1999). Fifty (50) pre-service primary school university students participated in this project and results indicated a strong relationship between students' learning performance, performance in the scientific reasoning abilities test, epistemic beliefs and the ability to use arguments during computational experiments. This paper suggests an implementable integration strategy that uses mathematical models for physics phenomena that are developed using algorithms, aiming to deepen students' conceptual understanding and scientific reasoning. After completing the course, the mechanics baseline test (MBT) and a test on Heat were administered. The results indicated that there was a significant difference in problem-solving skill test mean scores, as measured by the MBT, and the test on Heat among concrete, formal and postformal reasoners. Overall, this study provides evidence that scientific reasoning has a strong impact to learning performance, scientific reasoning, epistemological beliefs and argumentation while the methodology of the Computational Experiment provides essential tools to students to implement Inquiry based scenario. Students developed their scenarios using an open source repository using the computational experiment approach and created their experiments using the Argument-Driven Inquiry (ADI) laboratory approach. Results have implications for the effectiveness of the computational experiment as a methodology to be included in the STEM agenda.",,"Modelling, Computational experiment, Reasoning abilities, Epistemological beliefs, Argumentation"

We examine the underpinnings of this phenomenon using drift diffusion modeling (DDM). Partisans (N = 148) completed a sequential sampling task where they evaluated the honesty of Democrat or Republican politicians during a debate based on fact-check scores. We found that partisans required less and weaker evidence to correctly categorize the ingroup as more honest, and were more accurate on trials when the ingroup candidate was more honest, compared to the outgroup. DDM revealed that such tendencies arise from both a prior preference for categorizing the ingroup as more honest (i.e., biased starting point) and more precise accumulation of information favoring the ingroup candidate compared to the outgroup (i.e., biased drift rate). Moreover, individual differences in cognitive reasoning moderated task performance for the most devoted partisans and maintained divergent associations with the DDM parameters. This suggests that partisans may reach biased conclusions via different pathways depending on their depth of cognitive reasoning. These findings provide key insights into the mechanisms driving partisan divides in polarized environments, and can inform interventions that reduce impasse and conflict.",,"Partisan bias, Motivated cognition, Sequential sampling, Drift diffusion modeling, Cognitive reflection"

First, a firm needs to ensure that the exploration unit is sufficiently connected to other parts of the organization where key complementary assets reside while minimizing the number of linkages to reduce the influence of the “old” way of thinking on new exploration efforts, to reduce coordination costs, and to increase adaptive ability. Second, the “ideal” level of connectedness for structural ambidexterity ultimately depends on the number of valuable complementary assets in a firm’s possession.

Because these aspects are common to many problems, having a framework already designed and ready to use will not only speed the development of new codes, but also enhance compatibility between codes. Some of the most common aspects of computational physics problems are: a grid, a clock which tracks the flow of the simulation, and a set of models describing the dynamics of various quantities on the grid. Having a framework that could deal with these basic aspects of the simulation in a common way could provide great value to computational scientists by solving various numerical and class design issues that routinely arise. This paper describes the newly developed computational framework that we have built for rapidly prototyping new physics codes. This framework, called turboPy, is a lightweight physics modeling framework based on the design of the particle-in-cell code turboWAVE. It implements a class (called Simulation) which drives the simulation and manages communication between physics modules, a class (called PhysicsModule) which handles the details of the dynamics of the various parts of the problem, and some additional classes such as a Grid class and a Diagnostic class to handle various ancillary issues that commonly arise.

More specifically, we show how to improve existing voting-based ensemble models trained to predict the next-day exchange rate trend with no need for retraining or other costly computational tasks. We assume that calendar effects would constrain investors’ actions; furthermore, their constrained individual actions would collectively induce deterministic patterns in the financial time-series movement. Hence, financial time-series forecasting models could be prone to monthly repeat their performance patterns, and we could use this information to obtain better predictions and consistently achieve profit. To verify the effectiveness of our methodology, we predicted the sign of the US Dollar to Brazilian Real rate variation. Our proposed models generated a profit metric value 24% higher than the original voting-based ensemble models with 16% lower volatility, gathering two positive elements: higher return with lower risk. The experiments’ outcomes supported the hypothesis that there are considerable improvements with almost no extra computational effort by taking into account behavioral patterns in foreign exchange predictions.",,"Exchange rate, Behavioral finance, Ensemble models, Machine learning"

The Hausdorff distance is used to measure the similarity between two point sets in various applications. However, it is hard to compute the HD algorithm efficiently between very large-scale point sets while ensuring the accuracy of the HD. The directed HD algorithm has two loops (called the outer loop and the inner loop) for calculating MAX-MIN distance, and the state-of-the-art algorithms, such as the Early break method and the Diffusion search method, focused on reducing the iterations of the inner loop. Our algorithm, however, concentrates on reducing the iterations of the outer loop. The proposed method simultaneously computes the temporary HD and temporary minimum distances of points corresponding to the outer loop using the opposite HD computation with very small systematic samples. Thereafter, a strategy of ruling out is employed to exclude non-contributing points. The new approach reduces the problems of different grid sizes and highly overlapping point sets as well as the very large-scale point sets. 3-D point clouds and real brain tumor segmentation (MRI 3-D volumes) are used for comparing the performance of the proposed algorithm and the state-of-the-art HD algorithms. In experimental results with 3-D point clouds, the proposed method is more than at least 1.5 times as faster as the compared algorithms. And, in experimental results with MRI 3-D volumes, the proposed method achieves a better performance than the compared algorithms over all pairs regardless of the grid size. Thus, as a whole, the proposed algorithm outperforms the compared algorithms.",,"Hausdorff distance, Computational complexity, Point matching, 3-D point sets"

Therefore, this paper firstly proposes a thinking based on a linear piecewise-shape pricing strategy for guiding UES to decrease the peak-valley difference although storage has not been dispatched by utility and always operates in its maximum benefit. In addition, benefit of user with UES has been guaranteed to be non-decreased compared to traditional TOU. Then, this paper establishes a planning-operation co-optimization model for UES to pursue its maximum net benefit, in which the proposed electricity pricing strategy has been incorporated.

One is ‘epistemization’, making computational tasks refer explicitly to knowledge or beliefs of the agents performing them. The other line is using games as a model for computation, leading to ‘gamification’ of classical tasks, and computing by agents that may have preferences. This provides ingredients for a fundamental theory of computation that shifts from what is computed to how it is computed and by whom, moving from output to social behavior. The true impact of this shift is not in learning how to replace humans, but in creating new societies where humans and machines interact.

In that model, there were four boundedly rational behavioral rules (step-j, j=0, 1, 2, 3), each corresponding to an integer level of depth of reasoning. It is legitimate to ask for a justification of the restriction to these `integer' rules. Why is it not reasonable to suppose that some player believes that 50% of the population is step-0, and 50% is step-1, and so himself adopts something like a step-1.5 rule? This paper constructs a tractable model with potentially infinitely many non-integer rules and conducts comparison tests. The main conclusion is that allowing for non-integer rules does not help to explain the data. Therefore, by Occam's Razor, the integer rule model is preferred.

We discuss the topical structures of ICCS, and show how these topics have evolved over time in response to the topicality of various domains, technologies and methods, and how all these topics relate to one another. This analysis illustrates the multidisciplinary research and collaborations among scientific communities, by constructing static and dynamic networks from the topic modelling results and from the authors’ keywords. The results of this study provide insights regarding the past and future trends of core discussion topics in computational science and show how “computational thinking” has propagated across different fields of study. We used the Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) topic modelling algorithm to discover topics. The resulting topics were then manually labelled and grouped hierarchically on three levels. Next, we applied trend analysis and Change Point Analysis (CPA) to study the evolution of topics over seventeen years and to identify the growing and disappearing topics. We used Gephi to examine the static networks of topics, and an R library called DyA to analyse the dynamic networks of topics. We also analysed the conference as a platform for potential collaboration development through the perspective of collaboration networks. The results show that authors of ICCS papers continue to actively collaborate after the conference − on average authors collaborate with three other ICCS authors, − which suggests that ICCS is a valuable platform for collaboration development.",,"Topic modelling, Natural language processing, ICCS, Computational science, Graph theory, Collaboration networks"

Based on the empirical studies reviewed in this study, programming can be introduced to young learners as a stand-alone subject matter or can be integrated in the regular kindergarten curriculum with other subject areas such as music, movement and dance, art, science, mathematics, and literacy. In addition, programming can be infused in literacy and storytelling activities as a developmentally appropriate delivery approach.

Existing drugs only alleviate symptoms. Given repeated expensive drug failures, we assessed systematically whether approved and investigational AD drugs are targeting products of genes strongly associated with AD and whether these genes are targeted by existing drugs for other indications which could be re-purposed. Methods We identified genes strongly associated with late-onset AD from the loci of genetic variants associated with AD at genome-wide-significance and from a gene-based test applied to the most extensively genotyped late-onset AD case (n = 17,008)-control (n = 37,154) study, the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project. We used three gene-to-drug cross-references, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, Drugbank and Drug Repurposing Hub, to identify genetically validated targets of AD drugs and any existing drugs or nutraceuticals targeting products of the genes strongly associated with late-onset AD. Findings A total of 67 autosomal genes (forming 9 gene clusters) were identified as strongly associated with late-onset AD, 28 from the loci of single genetic variants, 51 from the gene-based test and 12 by both methods. Existing approved or investigational AD drugs did not target products of any of these 67 genes. Drugs for other indications targeted 11 of these genes, including immunosuppressive disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs targeting PTK2B gene products. Interpretation Approved and investigational AD drugs are not targeting products of genes strongly associated with late-onset AD. However, other drugs targeting products of these genes exist and could perhaps be re-purposing to combat late-onset AD after further scrutiny.",,"Alzheimer's disease, Genetics, Genetic drug targets, Gene-based test"

The work of Kosslyn, aimed at clarifying the basic process components and the general mechanics of the imaging process and Finke's probing of the levels of equivalence between imagery and perception, also belong to the conceptual category of research where the focus is on the nature and properties of imagery. Experimental evidence from a task devised by Finke indicates an important role of visual imagery in the integration of initially unrelated elements of experience into new combinations. This experimental evidence lends support to theories of symbolic representations that emphasize the potential of visual imagery as a vehicle for creative thought. Even if Chambers and Reisberg have overstated their case in their distinction between perceiving and imaging, they have, nevertheless, been able to demonstrate an important dimension of difference between two types of activities.",North-Holland,

To complement the group-based activities, this study designs and assesses an analytics-enhanced discussion forum for whole-class interactions. The forum adopts ontology-based recommender systems and anomaly detection techniques to tailor the threads and contents for individual students in a personalized way. This analytics-enhanced forum was implemented in a large-size undergraduate design course (n = 313), and data about student responses to this forum was compared with data from the previous year’s course that adopted a conventional forum (n = 280). From the statistical analysis, students learning with the analytics-enhanced forum demonstrated significantly higher degrees of design practices (specifically, empathize, define, ideate, and test), collaborative learning, and course satisfaction.

Many essential features of Turing-equivalent computation are not captured in definitions of computation as (digital) symbol manipulation.

Although distance education and online learning have been adopted gradually recently, it has become the 'New Normal.' In this situation of uncertainty, facilitators must keep themselves updated with the various teaching/learning strategies and encourage learners to get accustomed to the online classroom environment. Furthermore, assisting the learners with active engagement in the classes is essential. Hence, to create an instigated environment for assessing the competency level and addressing the motivational behaviour of the learners in the online courses, a modified version of the ""ARCS"" (Attention, Relevance, Confidence, and Satisfaction) model is used in this research work. The core objective of this model is to apply a modified motivational model, namely ""ARCS-PC,"" where PC represents Professional Competency. Professional competency includes Critical Thinking skills, Digital literacy, Creative Thinking, Problem-solving, and Time Management. The incorporation of digital quizzes, assignments, and interactive activities using Information and Communication Technology (ICT) tools was done in the ARCS-PC Model. The online classroom lectures and activities were conducted using the Microsoft Teams (MS Teams) educational platform. Linear regression is performed to analyze the modified ARCS-PC model. These technology-enabled online classes and ICT tools have helped teach lifelong learning, collaborative learning, a student-centric approach, and better competency skills to effectively engage students in online courses. In our proposed method, an improvement of 11.21 % was observed in the student's performance compared to a maximum of 8.8 % in the existing traditional models.

For living systems, mathematical relations emerge internally as an abstracting capacity in the course of development and adaptation to the external world. All living systems possess internal coding structures which represent their embedded description. They are anticipatory in the sense that the embedded description generates deterministic model of their behavior. If the model does not provide a correct result, they can evolve through the acquisition of new statements inside the embedded description that overcome limitations of the existing model. The newly generated statements acquire meaning in and from the changing environment. The growth of complexity, being a consequence of the internal active adaptation to externality performed by the systems, increases the amount of external work and generates the observed patterns of spatiotemporal structures of evolving systems. In living systems, the symbolic memory constraints are dynamic processes in themselves, co-evolving with the other components of biological systems. Separation of the symbolic memory and the dynamic laws (defined as the epistemic cut), required for self-replication of biological systems, forms the basis for their onto-epistemic relation to reality. In this regard, living systems possess their own internal abstracting capacity and invent mathematics. The digital structure of the genetic code is a manifestation of this mathematics.",,"Biological evolution, Biological code, Complexification, Computation, Epistemic cut, Hypercycle, Internal measurement, Relational biology, Univalent foundations"

Social media interactions, characterized by anonymity and performativity, can help differentiate between authentic perspectives and misinformation. With its diverse user base and wide-ranging discussions, Reddit provides a valuable data source for analyzing public sentiment. To explore changes in discourse, we investigated linguistic features such as clout, authenticity, emotional expression, and analytical thinking. We used Computer-Mediated Discourse Analysis (CMDA) and Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) software to conduct qualitative content analysis and quantitative goodness-of-fit tests. Analytical thinking reflects how systematically users present political arguments, while clout captures the confidence and authority of discourse, highlighting dominant voices. Authenticity measures the sincerity of discourse, and emotional tone reveals users’ feelings toward KSA. Our findings show an overall increase in analytical discourse and a decrease in negative tone, although emotional sentiment remained largely negative. Peaks in clout, authenticity, and emotional tone corresponded to major political events, indicating how such events shape public attitudes. These results suggest that significant political and social events influence both the content and tone of political discourse and may, in turn, impact public perceptions and emotions.",,"Reddit, KSA, LIWC-22, CMDA, Tone, Emotions, USA"

In this paper, we propose a sentence similarity analysis model to analyze the similarity in people’s opinions on hot topics in social media and news pages. Most of these data are unstructured or semi-structured sentences, so the accuracy of sentence similarity analysis largely determines the model’s performance. For the purpose of improving accuracy, we propose a novel method of sentence similarity computation to extract the syntactic and semantic information of the semi-structured and unstructured sentences. We mainly consider the subjects, predicates and objects of sentence pairs and use Stanford Parser to classify the dependency relation triples to calculate the syntactic and semantic similarity between two sentences. Finally, we verify the performance of the model with the Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus (MRPC), which consists of 4076 pairs of training sentences and 1725 pairs of test sentences, and most of the data came from the news of social data.

A complex system, in that regard, is literally one where multiple interactions occur and emerge among the components; and common to all research into complexity are the systems that have adapting, self-organizing, synchronizing, and reacting elements. As physicist Nigel Goldenfeld put very aptly, “Complexity starts when causality breaks down.” Complexity manifests as varying challenges in fields of different complex systems. The inherent complexity of the related phenomena in the fields is beyond the reductionist outlook of traditional science; thus, complexity requires an understanding that extends across a class of complex problems that have so many intricate and subtle attributes that are much more innovative and novel ways of thinking as well as applicable laws are of critical importance. Evolution, order and complexity reveal the relationship between natural and social worlds, which reflects a modern way of thinking that challenges the dichotomy of natural and social. This study provides a conceptual outline and historical account of complexity and complex systems as well as complex order processes toward modern scientific path from Darwin and onwards concerned with natural, applied and social sciences.

This highlights the familiar local-to-global aspect of border formation (linking of edge elements to form contours) with the much less studied global-to-local aspect (which edge elements form part of the same shape). To address this task we show how to incorporate certain high-level notions of distance and geometric arrangement into a form that can influence image-based edge information. The center of the argument is a reaction—diffusion equation that reveals how (global) aspects of the distance map (that is, shape) can be “read out” locally, suggesting a solution to the border ownership problem. Since the reaction—diffusion equation defines a field, a possible information processing role for the local field potential can be defined. We argue that such fields also underlie the Gestalt notion of closure, especially when it is refined using modern experimental techniques. An important implication of this theoretical argument is that, if true, then network modeling must be extended to include the substrate surrounding spiking neurons, including glia.",,"Computational vision, Border ownership, Local field potentials, Neural computation"

Predicting others’ actions requires strategic thinking, thus thinking about what the others might think and believe. Game theory provides a canonical model of strategic thinking implicit in the notion of equilibrium and common knowledge of rationality. Behavioral evidence shows departures from equilibrium play and suggests different models of strategic thinking based on bounded rationality. We report neural evidence in support of non-equilibrium models of strategic thinking. These models suggest a cognitive-hierarchy theory of brain and behavior, according to which people use different levels of strategic thinking that are associated with specific neural computations.",,

Modular Construction (MC) is another approach used to increase efficiency of both design and production. This paper combines these approaches in a novel methodology for generating modular design options for extensions of existing buildings (an efficacious form of building adaptation). The methodology focuses on key architectural design metrics such as energy use, daylighting, life cycle impact, life cycle costing and structural complexity, whereby a set of Pareto-optimal exploratory design options are generated for evaluation and further design development.

To achieve this goal, three major instances of knowledge transfer dynamics in agent-based computational social science are analysed. The first instance is the emergence of the research field. Relations of knowledge transfer and cross-fertilisation between agent-based computational social science and wider and more established disciplinary areas: complexity science, computational science and social science, are discussed. The second instance is the approach to scientific modelling in the field. It is shown how the practice of agent-based modelling is affected by the conflicting coexistence of shared methodological commitments transferred from both empirical and formal disciplines. Lastly, the third instance pertains internal practices of knowledge production and transmission.

Subsequent to this discussion, and by assuming that the Universe at some level can be well-described as a complex system, the paper explores the notion of ontology, or existence, from a complex systems perspective. It is argued that none of the traditional objects of science, or any objects from any discipline, formal or not, can be said to be real in any absolute sense although a substantial realism may be temporarily associated with them. The limitations of the natural sciences is discussed as well as the deep connection between the ‘hard’ and the ‘soft’ sciences.

This study examined whether scalable computational measures of spoken language, and smartphone usage pattern, could serve as digital biomarkers of clinical disorganization symptoms. Methods We examined in a longitudinal cohort of adults with a psychotic disorder, the associations between clinical measures of disorganization and computational measures of 1) spoken language derived from monthly, semi-structured, recorded clinical interviews; and 2) smartphone usage pattern derived via passive sensing technologies over the month prior to the interview. The language features included speech quantity, rate, fluency, and semantic regularity. The smartphone features included data missingness and phone usage during sleep time. The clinical measures consisted of the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS) conceptual disorganization, difficulty in abstract thinking, and poor attention, items. Mixed linear regression analyses were used to estimate both fixed and random effects. Results Greater severity of clinical symptoms of conceptual disorganization was associated with greater verbosity and more disfluent speech. Greater severity of conceptual disorganization was also associated with greater missingness of smartphone data, and greater smartphone usage during sleep time. While the observed associations were significant across the group, there was also significant variation between individuals. Conclusions The findings suggest that digital measures of speech disfluency may serve as scalable markers of conceptual disorganization.

However, the conventional model of biology seems to mistake cause and effect. According to the reductionist view, the causal chain in biology is chemicals → code → cognition. Despite this prevailing view, there are no examples in the literature to show that the laws of physics and chemistry can produce codes, or that codes produce cognition. Chemicals are just the physical layer of any information system. In contrast, although examples of cognition generating codes and codes controlling chemicals are ubiquitous in biology and technology, cognition remains a mystery. Thus, the central question in biology is: What is the nature and origin of cognition? In order to elucidate this pivotal question, we must cultivate a deeper understanding of information flows. Through this lens, we see that biological cognition is volitional (i.e., deliberate, intentional, or knowing), and while technology is constrained by deductive logic, living things make choices and generate novel information using inductive logic. Information has been called “the hard problem of life’ and cannot be fully explained by known physical principles (Walker et al., 2017). The present paper uses information theory (the mathematical foundation of our digital age) and Turing machines (computers) to highlight inaccuracies in prevailing reductionist models of biology, and proposes that the correct causation sequence is cognition → code → chemicals.",,"Cognition, Computation, Information, Negentropy, Induction, Evolution"

Although fMRI has been widely used to establish the neural networks implicated in ToM, little is known about the timing of ToM-related brain activity. We used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to measure the neural processes underlying ToM, as MEG provides very accurate timing and excellent spatial localization of brain processes. We recorded MEG activity during a false belief task, a reliable measure of ToM, in twenty young adults (10 females). MEG data were recorded in a 151 sensor CTF system (MISL, Coquitlam, BC) and data were co-registered to each participant's MRI (Siemens 3T) for source reconstruction. We found stronger right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ) activations in the false belief condition from 150ms to 225ms, in the right precuneus from 275ms to 375ms, in the right inferior frontal gyrus from 200ms to 300ms and the superior frontal gyrus from 300ms to 400ms. Our findings extend the literature by demonstrating the timing and duration of neural activity in the main regions involved in the “mentalizing” network, showing that activations related to false belief in adults are predominantly right lateralized and onset around 100ms. The sensitivity of MEG will allow us to determine spatial and temporal differences in the brain processes in ToM in younger populations or those who demonstrate deficits in this ability.",,"Theory of Mind, False belief, Magnetoencephalography (MEG), Right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ), Inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), Precuneus, Social cognition"

There has been considerable theoretical disagreement about the process by which this informational coordination is achieved. Some theories predict that the information encoded in gesture is not influenced by how information is verbally expressed. However, others predict that gestures encode only what is encoded in speech. This paper investigates this issue by comparing informational coordination between speech and gesture across different languages. Narratives in Turkish, Japanese, and English were elicited using an animated cartoon as the stimulus. It was found that gestures used to express the same motion events were influenced simultaneously by (1) how features of motion events were expressed in each language, and (2) spatial information in the stimulus that was never verbalized. From this, it is concluded that gestures are generated from spatio-motoric processes that interact on-line with the speech production process. Through the interaction, spatio-motoric information to be expressed is packaged into chunks that are verbalizable within a processing unit for speech formulation. In addition, we propose a model of speech and gesture production as one of a class of frameworks that are compatible with the data.",,"Semantic coordination, Cross-linguistic comparison, Speech production, Gesture production, Motion event"

While cross-sectional studies have highlighted correlations between ChatGPT use and learning performance, they fall short of establishing causality. This review examines experimental studies on ChatGPT's impact on student learning to address this gap. A comprehensive search across five databases identified 69 articles published between 2022 and 2024 for analysis. The findings reveal that ChatGPT interventions are predominantly implemented at the university level, cover various subject areas focusing on language education, are integrated into classroom environments as part of regular educational practices, and primarily involve direct student use of ChatGPT. Overall, ChatGPT improves academic performance, affective-motivational states, and higher-order thinking propensities; it reduces mental effort and has no significant effect on self-efficacy. However, methodological limitations, such as the lack of power analysis and concerns regarding post-intervention assessments, warrant cautious interpretation of results. This review presents four propositions from the findings: (1) distinguish between the quality of ChatGPT outputs and the positive effects of interventions on academic performance by shifting from well-defined problems in post-intervention assessments to more complex, project-based assessments that require skill demonstration, adopting proctored assessments, or incorporating metrics such as originality alongside quality; (2) evaluate long-term impacts to determine whether the positive effects on affective-motivational states are sustained or merely owing to novelty effect; (3) prioritise objective measures to complement subjective assessments of higher-order thinking; and (4) use power analysis to determine adequate sample sizes to avoid Type II errors and provide reliable effect size estimates.

Recent progress in computational neuroscience has made it possible to robustly define brain states and force transitions between them. Here, we review the state of the art and propose a framework for determining the functional hierarchical organization describing any given brain state. We describe the latest advances in creating sophisticated whole-brain computational models with interacting neuronal and neurotransmitter systems that can be studied fully in silico to predict and design novel pharmacological and electromagnetic interventions to rebalance them in disease.",,

This review explores the evidence for eye and visual pathway asymmetry, in health and in disease, and attempts to provide guidance for those studying the structure and function of the visual system, where recognition of symmetry or asymmetry may be essential. The principal question with regards to asymmetry is not ‘are the eyes the same?’, for some degree of asymmetry is pervasive, but ‘when are they importantly different?’. Knowing if right and left eyes are ‘importantly different’ could have significant consequences for deciding whether right or left eyes are included in an analysis or for examining the association between a phenotype and ocular parameter. The presence of significant asymmetry would also have important implications for the design of normative databases of retinal and optic nerve metrics. In this review, we highlight not only the universal presence of asymmetry, but provide evidence that some elements of the visual system are inherently more asymmetric than others, pointing to the need for improved normative data to explain sources of asymmetry and their impact on determining associations with genetic, environmental or health-related factors and ultimately in clinical practice.",,"Interocular symmetry, Asymmetry, Retina, Retinal imaging, Retinal vasculature, Patterning"

This study took place in a computational-science course where high-school students programmed simulations of physical systems, thus combining computer science (CS) and mathematics with physics learning. The study explored the ways in which CS affected the students' conceptual understanding of the physics behind formulas. The major part of the analysis process was qualitative, although some quantitative analysis was applied as well. Findings revealed that a great amount of the time was invested by the students on representing their physics knowledge in terms of computer science. Three knowledge domains were found to be applied: structural, procedural and systemic. A fourth domain which enabled reflection on the knowledge was found as well, the domain of execution. Each of the domains was found to promote the emergence of knowledge integration processes (Linn & Eylon, 2006, 2011), thus promoting students’ physics conceptual understanding.

Over the years there have been many developments in computational intelligence. At present, many other fields are part of the study and research in computational intelligence. With advances in cognitive sciences, more techniques of information processing by machines that show characteristics closely associated with human intelligence are being found. Some of these techniques have been studied for a long time, but in recent years there has been some maturity in the understanding and use of these techniques. One such technique is the use of semantics in computational intelligence. There has been a long-drawn-out philosophical debate between lingualism, which claims that there is no human thought without language, and “language of thought” theories, which believe that natural language is inessential to private thought. In an attempt to create intelligent machines, the use of semantics for knowledge representation and knowledge-based creation in a system follows the philosophy of lingualism. Different knowledge representations are used in a knowledge-based clinical decision support system. This chapter makes a study of various knowledge representations. The different theories behind the techniques used in the knowledge representations are discussed.

Previous research has predominantly centered on either trait-like individual differences or state-like changes in rumination, without integrating these aspects. The present study proposes a computational approach to investigate whether rumination serves as a compensatory or resilience mechanism by integrating both trait-like and state-like effects. Method Rumination and depressive symptoms were assessed (in N=100) pre-treatment and repeatedly throughout treatment. Mixed-level models were used to examine whether pre-treatment trait-like rumination interacted with a time-variant variable of in-treatment state-like changes in rumination to predict subsequent changes in treatment outcomes. These models were used to determine whether individuals with higher or lower pre-treatment trait-like levels of rumination benefited more from state-like reductions in rumination, thus contrasting the compensatory and resilience theoretical frameworks. Results As hypothesized, the findings support the compensatory framework: individuals with higher pre-treatment trait-like levels of rumination benefited most from greater state-like reductions in rumination during treatment, as evidenced by greater subsequent symptom reduction (p=.04). Conclusion The findings refine our understanding of rumination as an individual-specific mechanism of therapeutic change, dependent on the individual's trait-like levels of rumination. The proposed computational approach enabled an empirical comparison of the two main theoretical frameworks of treatment personalization, compensatory and resilience, offering new insights into mechanisms driving therapeutic change. Future studies could leverage the paradigm proposed here to examine for which patients and in what contexts mechanisms of change function as compensatory versus resilience mechanisms.",,"Rumination, compensation, resilience, complementing, capitalization, personalized treatment, mechanism of change"

Thus, the goal of the STCP is to partition a set of individuals into a set of synergistic teams: teams that are diverse in personality and gender and whose members cover all required competencies to complete a task. Furthermore, the STCP requires that all teams are balanced in that they are expected to exhibit similar performances when completing the task. We propose two efficient algorithms to solve the STCP. Our first algorithm is based on a linear programming formulation and is appropriate to solve small instances of the problem.

The modern way of thinking poses a challenge against the dichotomy between the natural world and social world, by taking into account the concepts around complexity, evolution and order. This study provides an overview encompassing multi-chaos, fractal, fractional and Artificial Intelligence (AI) way of thinking for the solution of the complex system problems concerned with natural and social sciences. Furthermore, ethical decision-making frameworks and strategies concerning big data and AI applications to provide assistance for the identification of the related problems in different settings and help thinking in a methodical manner with a deliberative compensating process so that tensions between conflicting aspects can be managed systematically. The values related to ethical issues, which are thorny in nature, point to being practical, flexible and problem-driven rather than purely theory-driven in order that dilemmas can be addressed and critical decision-making guided in a way beyond theoretical positions with a focus on applied aspects. Through the lenses of such transformative thinking along with mathematics-informed frameworks encompassing chaos, fractal and multi-fractional ways, the incorporation of technology, with Artificial Intelligence, as the most viable and far-reaching leg, is essentially required to be able to address and tackle complexity that has chaotic, nonlinear, and dynamic characteristics.

In the first section, the qualitative VB description of the elementary interactions is recalled and compared to the MO model. It is shown that the VB picture is fundamentally correct, even for the well-known cases of the low-lying states of dioxygen and the 4n/4n+2 aromaticity rule. The second section briefly discusses the classical VB method, which deals with atomic orbitals that are optimized for the free atoms and kept unchanged in molecules, then describes modern ab initio VB methods that all perform orbital optimization in molecular calculations. The generalized valence bond and spin-coupled theories both provide a one-configuration wavefunction. While the former is generally used with some time-saving restrictions such as the strong-orthogonality restriction and the perfect-pairing approximation, the latter releases any orthogonality constraint and allows all possible spin couplings. Multiconfiguration methods are also discussed, as well as methods using different orbitals for different structures. Some computational applications of these methods are presented in the last section. It is shown that if given full freedom to optimize its shape with the variational principle as a unique criterion, a one-configuration wavefunction spontaneously takes the form of a VB wavefunction displaying localized orbitals, and presents a picture in terms of hybrid orbitals and/or resonance between limiting structures, very close to the traditional qualitative picture. The concept of hybridization is firmly supported, as the unique outcome of the highest computational level still compatible with the orbital picture. The description of conjugated systems in terms of resonating Kekulé structures is also fully justified and shown to be the best framework for discussing questions such as the distortive tendencies of conjugated π-electronic systems, or violations of Hund's rules. The ab initio VB approach can be used for quantifying some traditional paradigms such as the role of the delocalization energy in the acidity of carboxylic acids and enols, or in the properties of the amide/thioamide functional group. It is also shown to be an elegant solution to some difficult computational problems like the symmetry-breaking artefact or the inclusion of dynamical correlation in the description of the chemical bond. Lastly, some of the methods presented here are shown to be appropriate for the calculation of diabatic potential surfaces, with applications to the Shaik–Pross reactivity model of the VB curve-crossing correlation diagrams.",,"Valence bond, Hybridization, Symmetry breaking, Resonance energy, Breathing orbitals"

The image-to-image translation aims to learn the mapping between two visual domains. At the beginning of designing the existing image-to-image translation method, it was not considered whether the generated image is realistic or not. In this work, we present a novel approach to address the problem of generating fidelity in the area of image-to-image translation. In particular, humans judge whether an image is realistic or not with unique human vision's feeling rather than paying attention to the real-world semantics. Inspired by this, we propose an effective network loss to capture the pixel-level representations and human vision system information for verisimilar image-to-image translation. To enforce both structural and translation-model consistency during adaptation, we propose a novel Just-Noticeable-Difference loss based on a visual recognition task. The Just-Noticeable-Difference loss not only guides the overall representation to be discriminative but also enforces our cycle loss before and after mapping between domains. Experimental results show that our approach is able to generate realistic images using unpaired training data, on a wide range of tasks. Besides, we measure realism with Fréchet Inception Distance and diversity with the number of statistically-different bins, Jensen–Shannon divergence, and a perceptual distance metric. We also apply our approach to domain adaptation and show competitive performance when compared to others on several datasets.",Academic Press,"Computational Knowledge Vision, Visual computing, Just noticeable difference, Domain adaptation, Generative adversarial network"

There are a variety of ESSs for renewable energy with vastly different characteristics. The problem of diversity of characteristics in selecting the most appropriate ESS can be approached as a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem. This research evaluates sustainable ESSs through a case study in Egypt. A sustainable computational approach is presented through which experts can use verbal expressions to express their opinions in determining the priorities of the dimensions that affect the selection of ESSs. Determining the appropriate energy storage system requires consideration of several main dimensions such as the technology dimension, environmental dimension, economic dimension, and social-political dimension and, in addition to the sub-indicators. Hence, this research applies a hybrid MCDM approach that deals with different indicators and characteristics. Also, uncertainty in applying the proposed approach was dealt with by a spherical fuzzy (SF) environment and by using the spherical fuzzy numbers (SFNs). At first, the SF analytical hierarchy process (SF-AHP) method was used to assess the priorities of the four main dimensions and their sub-indicators. Then, the SF mixed aggregation by comprehensive normalization technique (SF-MACONT) was applied to evaluate and rank the ESSs selected for analysis through research. An illustrative case study was presented that included seven ESSs out of the eighteen systems listed in the research to confirm the feasibility of the developed approach. Sensitivity analysis was carried out by changing some parameters like λ, μ, δ, and ϑ based on the SF-MACONT method and changing the weights of some main dimensions. A comparative analysis with some MCDM approaches was conducted to show the advantages of the developed approach through its flexibility and built-in parameters. The findings show that the technology dimension is the most influential in choosing a sustainable ESS, while the economic dimension is the least influential.

While these abnormalities are consistently found at the group level, a particularly difficult and important challenge is to translate these findings into clinically useful tests for single patients. In this paper, we argue that generative models of eye movement data, which allow for inferring individual computational and physiological mechanisms, could contribute to filling this gap. We present a selective overview of eye movement paradigms with clinical relevance for schizophrenia and review existing computational approaches that rest on (or could be turned into) generative models. We conclude by outlining desirable clinical applications at the individual subject level and discuss the necessary validation studies.",,

This phenomenon, referred to as the temporal discounting sign effect, is thought to result from the greater anticipated emotional impact of waiting for a negative outcome (dread) compared to waiting for a positive outcome (mixture of savoring and impatience). The impact of such anticipatory emotions has been proposed to rely on episodic future thinking. We evaluated this proposal by examining the presence and magnitude of a sign effect in the intertemporal decisions of individuals with hippocampal amnesia, who are severely impaired in their ability to engage in episodic mental simulation, and by comparing their patterns of choices to those of healthy controls. We also measured loss aversion, the tendency to assign greater value to losses compared to equivalent gains, to verify that any reduction in the sign effect in the hippocampal lesion group could not be explained by a group difference in loss aversion. Results showed that participants with hippocampal amnesia exhibited a sign effect, with less discounting of monetary losses compared to gains, that was similar in magnitude to that of controls. Loss aversion, albeit greater in the hippocampal compared to the control group, did not account for the sign effect. These results indicate that the sign effect does not depend on the integrity of hippocampally mediated episodic processes. They suggest instead that the impact of anticipatory emotions can be factored into decisions via semantic future thinking, drawing on non-contextual knowledge about oneself.",,"Hippocampus, Amnesia, intertemporal choice, Temporal discounting, Sign effect, Money loss versus gain"

Salicylhydroxamic acid (SHA) exhibits enhanced selectivity for bastnäsite over calcite in microflotation experiments. Through a multifaceted approach, leveraging density functional theory calculations, and advanced spectroscopic methods, we provide molecular-level mechanistic insight to this selectivity. The hydroxamic acid moiety introduces strong interactions at metal-atom surface sites and hinders subsurface-cation stabilization at vacancy-defect sites, in calcite especially. Resulting from hydrogen-bond-induced interactions, SHA lies flat on the bastnäsite surface and shows a tendency for multilayer formation at high coverages. In this conformation, SHA complexation with bastnäsite metal ions is stabilized, leading to advanced flotation performance. In contrast, SHA lies perpendicular to the calcite surface due to a difference in cationic spacing. We anticipate that these insights will motivate rational design and selection of future collector molecules for enhanced ore beneficiation.",,"Chemical Engineering, Spectroscopy, Physical Inorganic Chemistry, Surface Chemistry"

The research literature in cognitive psychology teems with tasks where intuitive thinking leads subjects to “non-normative” answers, including tasks for which they have all the knowledge necessary for the normative answer. The best explanation to date for such phenomena is dual-process theory, which stipulates the activation of a quick automatic intuitive process (System 1), together with the failure of the heavy, lazy, and computationally expensive analytical process (System 2) to intervene and correct the intuitive response. In an earlier paper, we have documented a clash between intuitive and analytical thinking concerning functions, which we have termed the changing-the-input phenomenon. The discovery of the changing-the-input phenomenon, however, left us with a puzzle: Why has this phenomenon concerning functions – a purely mathematical concept – been observed in computer science classes but not in mathematics ones? The purpose of the present paper is to address this puzzle. More generally we ask, under what conditions the changing-the-input phenomenon will or will not be manifested? Still more generally, in learning about functions, when is the intuitive scaffolding of functions via actions-on-tangible-objects helpful, and when does it get in the way of deeper understanding?",,"Functions, Composition of functions, Intuitive thinking, Analytical thinking, Dual-process theory, Actions on objects, Changing-the-input misconception"

Although originally described in the visual system, corollary discharge may exist in the auditory system, whereby signals from motor speech commands prepare auditory cortex for self-generated speech. While associated with sensorimotor systems, it might also apply to inner speech or thought, regarded as our most complex motor act. We had four aims in the studies summarized in this paper: (1) to demonstrate the corollary discharge phenomenon during talking and inner speech in human volunteers using event-related brain potentials (ERPs), (2) to demonstrate that the corollary discharge is abnormal in patients with schizophrenia, (3) to demonstrate the role of frontal speech areas in the corollary discharge during talking, and (4) to relate the dysfunction of the corollary discharge in schizophrenia to auditory hallucinations. Using EEG and ERP measures, we addressed each aim in patients with schizophrenia (DSM IV) and healthy control subjects. The N1 component of the ERP reflected dampening of auditory cortex responsivity during talking and inner speech in control subjects but not in patients. EEG measures of coherence indicated inter-dependence of activity in the frontal speech production and temporal speech reception areas during talking in control subjects, but not in patients, especially those who hallucinated. These data suggest that a corollary discharge from frontal areas where thoughts are generated fails to alert auditory cortex that they are self-generated, leading to the misattribution of inner speech to external sources and producing the experience of auditory hallucinations.",,"Schizophrenia, Corollary discharge, N1, EEG coherence"

Aiming to reduce the influence of non-complete ground threat information on UAH path planning, a ground threat prediction-based path planning method is proposed based on artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm by collaborative thinking strategy. Firstly, a dynamic threat distribution probability model is developed based on the characteristics of typical ground threats. The dynamic no-fly zone of the UAH is simulated and established by calculating the distribution probability of ground threats in real time. Then, a dynamic path planning method for UAH is designed in complex environment based on the real-time prediction of ground threats. By adding the collision warning mechanism to the path planning model, the flight path could be dynamically adjusted according to changing no-fly zones. Furthermore, a hybrid enhanced ABC algorithm is proposed based on collaborative thinking strategy. The proposed algorithm applies the leader-member thinking mechanism to guide the direction of population evolution, and reduces the negative impact of local optimal solutions caused by collaborative learning update strategy, which makes the optimization performance of ABC algorithm more controllable and efficient. Finally, simulation results verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed ground threat prediction path planning method.",,"UAH, Path planning, Ground threat prediction, Hybrid enhanced, Collaborative thinking"

Enculturation is the acquisition of cognitive practices such as symbol-based mathematical practices, reading, and writing during ontogeny. Enculturation is associated with significant changes to the organization and connectivity of the brain and to the functional profiles of embodied actions and motor programs. Furthermore, it relies on scaffolded cultural learning in the cognitive niche. The purpose of this paper is to explore the components of symbol-based mathematical practices. Phylogenetically, these practices are the result of concerted organism-niche interactions that have led from approximate number estimations to the emergence of discrete, symbol-based mathematical operations. Ontogenetically, symbol-based mathematical practices are associated with plastic changes to neural circuitry, action schemata, and motor programs. It will be suggested that these practices rely on previously acquired capacities such as subitizing and counting. With these considerations in place, I will argue that computations, understood in the sense of Turing (1936), are a specific kind of symbol-based mathematical practices that can be realized by human organisms, machines, or by hybrid organism-machine systems.

This paper describes a new approach to participatory, computer-assisted scenario development that we call scenario discovery, which aims to address these challenges. The approach defines scenarios as a set of plausible future states of the world that represent vulnerabilities of proposed policies, that is, cases where a policy fails to meet its performance goals. Scenario discovery characterizes such sets by helping users to apply statistical or data-mining algorithms to databases of simulation-model-generated results in order to identify easy-to-interpret combinations of uncertain model input parameters that are highly predictive of these policy-relevant cases. The approach has already proved successful in several high impact policy studies. This paper systematically describes the scenario discovery concept and its implementation, presents statistical tests to evaluate the resulting scenarios, and demonstrates the approach on an example policy problem involving the efficacy of a proposed U.S. renewable energy standard. The paper also describes how scenario discovery appears to address several outstanding challenges faced when applying traditional scenario approaches in contentious public debates.",,"Scenario Discovery, Scenario planning, Robust decision making"

For over a decade since a push toward “Toxicity Testing in the 21st Century,” the field has focused on massive data generation efforts to inform computational approaches for preliminary hazard identification, adverse outcome pathways that link molecular initiating events and key events to apical outcomes, and high-throughput approaches to risk-based ratios of bioactivity and exposure to inform relative priority and safety assessment. Projects like the interagency Tox21 program and the US EPA ToxCast program have generated dose-response information on thousands of chemicals, identified and aggregated information from legacy systems, and created tools for access and analysis. The resulting information has been used to develop computational models as viable options for regulatory applications. This progress has introduced challenges in data management that are new, but not unique, to toxicology. Some of the key questions require critical thinking and solutions to promote semantic interoperability, including: (1) identification of bioactivity information from NAMs that might be related to a biological process; (2) identification of legacy hazard information that might be related to a key event or apical outcomes of interest; and, (3) integration of these NAM and traditional data for computational modeling and prediction of complex apical outcomes such as carcinogenesis. This work reviews a number of toxicology-related efforts specifically related to bioactivity and toxicological data interoperability based on the goals established by Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) Data Principles.

In order to capture the effect knowledge that can efficiently aid high-level product innovation, this article proposes a new computational method. The method stems from a novel effect knowledge representation considering both functional and technical area features, and utilizes functional-flow terms of Functional Basis and technical area categories of international patent classification (IPC) respectively to standardize the modelling of the two kinds of features. Based on such representation, the method reasonably combines syntactic analysis, WordNet and word vector technologies to extract the desired effect knowledge from IPC text. To evaluate the method, this article first compares the acquired knowledge with those in a comprehensive human-compiled effect database, and then applies the knowledge to aid the innovation design of several mechanical products with different technical backgrounds. Evaluation results and the discussion based on them suggest the feasibility and potential of the proposed method in automatically acquiring well-organized effect knowledge system, as well as in aiding high-level product innovation.",,"TRIZ, Product innovation design, Effect knowledge representation, Functional Basis, IPC"

Yet, little is known about the effects of these skills on children's cognitive development. In a cluster-randomized controlled trial, we examined how 1st-grade children's gains in coding skills that follow instructional intervention transfer to two important executive functions (EFs): planning and response inhibition. One-hundred seventy-nine (179) first graders from 5 schools and 10 class groups, with no prior experience of coding, were randomly assigned to an experimental (coding, 5 classes) or control (standard STEM, 5 classes) instructional condition. The experimental intervention involved 8 h of coding activities (two weekly lessons for 4 weeks), through the Code.org platform. Children in the control group were exposed to standard STEM instruction. Four coding tasks drawn from Code.org, two standardized planning tasks (Elithorn maze test and Tower of London, ToL, test) and two standardized response inhibition tasks (NEPSY-II inhibition subtest and numerical Stroop), were used to assess children's skills at the pretest and posttest (after the instructional intervention). To measure retention, the same skills were also assessed for 44 children from the experimental group 5 weeks from the posttest (follow up). The results show that practice with coding through Code.org not only improved measurably children's ability to solve coding problems, but also their EFs, increasing the time children spent planning, their ability to solve standardized planning tasks, and to inhibit prepotent responses. Such findings add to the still limited literature on the cognitive effects of coding, deepening our understanding of the positive implications of introducing Computational Thinking early in the school curriculum.",,"Coding, Computational thinking, Executive function, Primary school children, Problem-solving"

The Bayesian perspective on the mind offers unique insights and tools that may help address a variety of mental health conditions. Psychopathological dysfunctions are often connected to altered predictive and active inference processes, in which cognitive and physiological pathogenic beliefs shape the clinical condition and its symptoms. However, there is a lack of general empirical models that integrate cognitive beliefs, physiological experience, and symptoms in healthy and clinical populations. In this study, we examined the relationship between altered predictive mechanisms, interoception, and pathological bodily distortions in healty individuals and in individuals suffering from anorexia nervosa (AN). AN patients (N=15) completed a Virtual Reality Full-Body Illusion along with interoceptive tasks twice: at hospital admission during an acute symptomatological phase (Time 1) and after a 12-week outpatient clinical weight-restoring rehabilitative program (Time 2). Results were compared to a healthy control group. Our findings indicated that higher levels of interoceptive metacognitive awareness were associated with a greater embodiment. However, unlike in healthy participants, AN patients' interoceptive metacognition was linked to embodiment even in multisensory mismatching (asynchronous) conditions. In addition, unlike in healthy participants, higher interoceptive metacognition in AN patients was related to prior abnormal bodily distortions during the acute symptomatology phase. Prediction errors in bodily estimates predicted posterior bodily estimate distortions after the illusion, but while this relationship was only significant in the synchronous condition in healthy participants, there was no significant difference between synchronous and asynchronous conditions in AN patients. Despite the success of the rehabilitation program in restoring some dysfunctional patterns in the AN group, prediction errors and posterior estimate distortions were present at hospital discharge. Our findings suggest that individuals with AN prioritize interoceptive metacognitive processes (i.e., confidence in their own perceived sensations rather than their actual perceptions), disregarding bottom-up bodily inputs in favour of their prior altered top-down beliefs. Moreover, even if the rehabilitative program partially mitigated these alterations, the pathological condition impaired the patients' ability to coherently update their prior erroneous expectations with real-time multisensory bottom-up bodily information, possibly locking the patients in the experience of a distorted prior top-down belief. These results suggest new therapeutic perspectives and introduce the framework of regenerative virtual therapy (RVT), which aims at utilizing technology-based somatic modification techniques to restructure the maladaptive priors underlying a pathological condition.",,"Interoception, Anorexia nervosa, Virtual reality, Bodily illusion, Bayesian, Prediction error"

Concerning mandrels technology, the detachable mandrel concept is chosen among others. Their engineering is conducted conventionally based on free-thinking design approaches, as well as expertise and overconfidence. Consequently, the demoulding process of the concave surface is inefficient due to the lack of adequate dismantling functions of the respective mandrel, leading to damage of the composite material during demoulding, mandrel rework and delays. These inconveniences motivated a reexamination of the mandrels design process. Thus, three structured design methods were incorporated: Design for Manufacturing and Assembly (DFMA), Functional Analysis (FA) and Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TIPS, a.k.a. TRIZ). Their synergistic implementation allowed the correct demoulding of the concave surface of revolution. In a second stage, this experience serves as reference for proposing a comprehensive, iterative, prescriptive and unified approach aimed at filament-wound products. It focuses on the base material (composites) and the manufacturing process (filament winding), being applicable to other fabrication processes of composite products. It is based on three models reported in the literature: one for metals, one for composites and one for filament-wound composites. Each of its steps is carried out with well-known structured design methods employed in products and systems engineering, including but not limited to DFMA, FA and TRIZ. As regards results, at the level of the design problem of the mandrels, the importance of the correct establishment of mechanical functions – dismantling in this case – is observed. In particular, how the lack of demoulding functions impacts unfavorably the quality of the final product. As respects the comprehensive approach, a significant outcome is the “filament winding thinking,” as an evolution of other schemes such as “metals” or “composites thinking” followed to generically develop products according to the nature of their base material.",,"Composites thinking, Design method, Filament winding, Product engineering, TRIZ"

Visualization can be an interface to a simulation of a complex system; the visualization, combined with the simulation, can create a powerful cognitive augmentation. The visualization is a two-way interface, although highly asymmetric, with far higher bandwidth communication from the machine to the human than in the other direction. The high-bandwidth visualization channel is then used to deliver the results of modeling exercises and database searches. One way to approach the design of an information system is to consider the cost of knowledge. The result of this approach is a kind of cognitive information economics. Activities are analyzed according to the value of what is gained and the cost incurred. There are two kinds of costs: resource costs and opportunity costs. The chapter explores both of these and the economics of cognition and the cognitive cost of knowledge.",Academic Press,

The source of output, Hawking radiation, is considered along with the constraints imposed by the holographic principle which limit the number of degrees of freedom in the system and consequently the maximum usable information. The Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is converted from the traditional form in terms of the horizon area to that of the Shannon entropy, establishing an analogy between the physical and computational perspectives of the system. Next examples are considered to establish the approximate order of the necessary excitation energy and the resulting gamma-ray interactions which form the input from the observer. Finally, the Turing completeness of the language for this model is considered through a simulation of the Turing machine.

In a higher-order setting, such queries perform program analysis. This is beyond the expressive power of traditional term rewriting systems, such as lambda-calculus or combinatory logic, as they are extensional. In such settings it has been necessary to encode or quote the program before analysis. However, there are intensional calculi, specifically confluent term rewriting systems, that can analyse higher-order programs within the calculus proper, without quotation; there are even programs that produce the Goedel numbers of their program argument. This paper summarizes the current situation. Highlights include the following observations. We have known since 2011 that the simplest intensional calculus, SF-calculus, supports arbitrary queries of closed normal forms, including equality, pattern-matching, searching and self-interpretation. Recent work, verified using the Coq proof assistant, has shown that all recursive programs can be represented as closed normal forms in SF-calculus, and even in combinatory logic. Thus, we can here deduce that SF-calculus (but not combinatory logic) can define queries of programs. These results are compatible with direct support for lambda-abstraction. Although these results conflict with the traditional understanding of expressive power of combinatory logic and λ-calculus, as developed by Church and Kleene, our recent publication has shown that their approach is compromised by its reliance on encodings. To drive the point home, this paper uses a non-standard encoding to lambda-define a trivial solution of the Halting Problem.",,"Intensional computation, Higher-order functions, SF-calculus, Foundations of computation"

Simon’s theory of human problem solving is analyzed in the light of Turing’s work on Solvable and Unsolvable Problems. It is suggested here that bounded rationality results from the fact that the deliberations required for searching computationally complex spaces exceed the actual complexity that human beings can handle. The immediate consequence is that satisficing becomes the general criterion of decision makers and heuristics are the procedures used for achieving their goals. In such decision problems, it is demonstrated that bounded rationality and satisficing are more general than orthodox, non-cognitive, Olympian rationality and optimization, respectively, and not the other way about.",,"Bounded rationality, Satisficing, Heuristics, Computability, Computational complexity"

Model descriptions typically include only the explicit decisions and are silent on value judgments that may explain these decisions. Eliciting scientists’ mental models, a systematic approach to determining how they think about climate risk management, can help to gain a clearer understanding of their modeling decisions. In order to identify and represent the role of values, beliefs and preferences on decisions, we used an augmented mental models research approach, namely values-informed mental models (ViMM). We conducted and qualitatively analyzed interviews with eleven climate risk management scientists. Our results suggest that these scientists use a similar decision framework to each other to think about modeling climate risk management tradeoffs, including eight specific decisions ranging from defining the model objectives to evaluating the model’s results. The influence of values on these decisions varied between our scientists and between the specific decisions. For instance, scientists invoked ethical values (e.g., concerns about human welfare) when defining objectives, but epistemic values (e.g., concerns about model consistency) were more influential when evaluating model results. ViMM can (i) enable insights that can inform the design of new computational models and (ii) make value judgments explicit and more inclusive of relevant values.

SRP was hypothesized to influence this goal competition process by encouraging distracting self-generated thinking. We used a spatial CWM task to examine if SRP instigated such thoughts, and employed eye-tracking to examine rehearsal interference in eye-movement and self-generated thinking in pupil size. The results showed that SRP was associated with lower performance and higher rates of self-generated thought.

Consequently, the development of mathematical competence is regarded as the formation of a system of meaningful mathematical actions that constitute that activity. At a general theoretical level these approaches can be shown to be basically different and even incompatible. With regard to mathematics education the differences are illustrated with respect to several themes such as task-analysis, automatization, and the learning of elementary arithmetic.

Transient selection of subnetworks by metabotropic receptors and G protein-gated ion channels,"Nikolić, Danko",2023,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiolchem.2023.107820,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1476927123000117,"Perhaps the most important question posed by brain research is: How the brain gives rise to the mind. To answer this question, we have primarily relied on the connectionist paradigm: The brain’s entire knowledge and thinking skills are thought to be stored in the connections; and the mental operations are executed by network computations. I propose here an alternative paradigm: Our knowledge and skills are stored in metabotropic receptors (MRs) and the G protein-gated ion channels (GPGICs). Here, mental operations are assumed to be executed by the functions of MRs and GPGICs. As GPGICs have the capacity to close or open branches of dendritic trees and axon terminals, their states transiently re-route neural activity throughout the nervous system. First, MRs detect ligands that signal the need to activate GPGICs. Next, GPGICs transiently select a subnetwork within the brain. The process of selecting this new subnetwork is what constitutes a mental operation – be it in a form of directed attention, perception or making a decision. Synaptic connections and network computations play only a secondary role, supporting MRs and GPGICs. According to this new paradigm, the mind emerges within the brain as the function of MRs and GPGICs whose primary function is to continually select the pathways over which neural activity will be allowed to pass. It is argued that MRs and GPGICs solve the scaling problem of intelligence from which the connectionism paradigm suffers.",,"Scaling problem, Explanatory gap, Connectionism, Metabotropic receptors, G protein-gated ion channels, Practopoiesis"

Yet, developing such models can be greatly hampered by the need to acquire and represent information pertaining to the psychological and social aspects of decision-making within these groups. Currently, there are numerous techniques and tools to help facilitate the elicitation and structuring of knowledge within expert-type systems—particularly those that focus on technical processes such as mechanical troubleshooting [3]. However, few techniques and tools have been developed for models that are intended to represent and assess the decision making of groups within different societies—particularly including cultural elements within these societies. This paper seeks to help address this challenge by discussing an approach to eliciting and structuring cross-cultural psychosocial and behavioral-economic elements within a theory-based assessment model. This work was developed to address the needs of Sandia National Laboratories’ Behavioral Influence Assessment modeling capability, which assesses decision-making within societies. The main component of the knowledge engineering effort is what we call the “knowledge structure.” The knowledge structure acts as scaffolding for the organization of psychosocial processes underlying decision-making, as well as the actual content of that knowledge with respect to a modeled society.",,"Knowledge elicitation, Knowledge structure, Cognitive modeling, Social modeling, Systems modeling, Country assessments"

Digital twins have emerged as a concept that effectively merges the physical and the digital worlds in cyber-physical production systems. The computational power of digital systems is leveraged to collect and aggregate data that are analyzed and presented to a human decision-maker. Taking a human-centric perspective, the digital twin should be designed to enhance human capabilities, accommodate the needs of people, and mitigate shortcomings of the human mind.

The approach taken by many modelers is to build larger models with greater complexity to deal with structural uncertainty, and run a few highly detailed scenarios under different input assumptions to address parametric uncertainty. The result is often large and inflexible models used to conduct analysis that offers little insight. This paper introduces a technique borrowed from the operations research literature called modeling to generate alternatives (MGA) as a way to flex energy models and systematically explore the feasible, near-optimal solution space in order to develop alternatives that are maximally different in decision space but perform well with regard to the modeled objectives.

Various other regions are also found activated in this investigation, in which an exploratory, hypotheses-generating approach determined relatively “liberal” statistical thresholds. The consciousness of action is an important component of consciousness. However, the most common approach to the study of consciousness and its neural counterpart in cognitive neuroscience is via perception and visual awareness. A variety of brain mapping techniques, from PET and functional magnetic resonance imaging to electrical scalp recording, have been already used in investigations directly addressing visual awareness in normal subjects and patients with neurological disorders. A paradigm that is extremely suitable for the examination of conscious perception is binocular rivalry.

It then analyses this workflow from a theoretical perspective, namely through Edwin Hutchins' materially anchored conceptual blending, Lambros Malafouris' Material Engagement Theory (MET) and John Searle's concepts of intentionality.

Swarm intelligence evolution-based gene selection algorithms can never circumvent the problem that the population is prone to local optima in the process of gene selection. To tackle this challenge, previous research has focused primarily on two aspects: mitigating premature convergence to local optima and escaping from local optima. In contrast to these strategies, this paper introduces a novel perspective by adopting reverse thinking, where the issue of local optima is seen as an opportunity rather than an obstacle. Building on this foundation, we propose MOMOGS-PCE, a novel gene selection approach that effectively exploits the advantageous characteristics of populations trapped in local optima to uncover global optimal solutions. Specifically, MOMOGS-PCE employs a novel population initialization strategy, which involves the initialization of multiple populations that explore diverse orientations to foster distinct population characteristics. The subsequent step involved the utilization of an enhanced NSGA-II algorithm to amplify the advantageous characteristics exhibited by the population. Finally, a novel exchange strategy is proposed to facilitate the transfer of characteristics between populations that have reached near maturity in evolution, thereby promoting further population evolution and enhancing the search for more optimal gene subsets. The experimental results demonstrated that MOMOGS-PCE exhibited significant advantages in comprehensive indicators compared with six competitive multi-objective gene selection algorithms. It is confirmed that the “reverse-thinking"" approach not only avoids local optima but also leverages it to uncover superior gene subsets for cancer diagnosis.",,"Gene selection, Microarray data, Multi-orientation, Multi-objective, Reverse thinking"

Therefore, providing a quick, accessible, and simple tool utilizing items related to ASD to these families may increase the likelihood they will seek professional assessment and is vital to the early detection and treatment of ASD. This study aims at identifying fewer, albeit influential, features in common ASD screening methods in order to achieve efficient screening as demands on evaluating the items’ influences on ASD within existing tools is urgent. To achieve this aim, a computational intelligence method called Variable Analysis (Va) is proposed that considers feature-to-class correlations and reduces feature-to-feature correlations. The results of the Va have been verified using two machine learning algorithms by deriving automated classification systems with respect to specificity, sensitivity, positive predictive values (PPVs), negative predictive values (NPVs), and predictive accuracy. Experimental results using cases and controls related to items in three common screening methods, along with features related to individuals, have been analysed and compared with results obtained from other common filtering methods. The results exhibited that Va was able to derive fewer numbers of features from adult, adolescent, and child screening methods yet maintained competitive predictive accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity rates.",,"Accuracy, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Behaviour science, Classifiers, Computational intelligence, Data mining, Feature analysis, Machine learning, Sensitivity, Specificity"

Children are evidently instructed in the reality of class bodies and the logic of social structure before they have any first-hand acquaintance with these social processes; indeed, by working the embodied relations of class domination into the role play and role learning of the pre-school years, we make it difficult for them to have any unmediated first-hand experience that would militate against these habitual distinctions.",,"Animals, Totemism, Class body, Busytown, Symbolic domination, Division of labor"

More precisely, the focus was on the thinking vs feeling personality dimension (MBTI), and it was tested whether this personality “interacts” with exposure to a matching advertising appeal: rational vs. emotional political ad. To do so, two different methodological approaches were used: 1) a machine learning approach; 2) a self-report survey measure of personality. Results revealed significant “congruence effects” between personality and ad appeal, and showed that perceived ad relevance was serving as the underlying mechanism (mediator). However, these results were only found when the self-report measure of personality was used. When the algorithmic approach was used, no significant results were found.

Subsequently, we relax the perfect rationality assumption via the use of a level-k thinking framework that allows the evaders to not exhibit the same levels of rationality. Such rationality policies are computed by using a reinforcement learning-based architecture and are proven to form Nash policies as the thinking levels increase. Finally, in the case of multiple pursuers against multiple targets, we develop a switched learning scheme with multiple convergence sets by assigning the most intelligent pursuers to the most intelligent evaders.",,"Game theory, Target tracking, Bounded rationality, Reinforcement learning, Switched systems, Target allocation"

This theory holds that this process is conducted by two main controllers: a goal-directed system and a habitual system. In the reinforcement learning (RL) domain, the habitual behaviors are connected with model-free methods, in which appropriate actions are learned through trial-and-error experiences. However, goal-directed behaviors are associated with model-based methods of RL, in which actions are selected using a model of the environment. Studies on cognitive control also suggest that during processes like decision-making, some cortical and subcortical structures work in concert to monitor the consequences of decisions and to adjust control according to current task demands. Here a computational model is presented based on dual system theory and cognitive control perspective of decision-making. The proposed model is used to simulate human performance on a variant of probabilistic learning task. The basic proposal is that the brain implements a dual controller, while an accompanying monitoring system detects some kinds of conflict including a hypothetical cost-conflict one. The simulation results address existing theories about two event-related potentials, namely error related negativity (ERN) and feedback related negativity (FRN), and explore the best account of them.

It is unknown if the use of such methods can successfully investigate prediagnosis purchases linked to self-medication of symptoms of ovarian cancer. Objective The aims of this study were to gain new domain knowledge from women’s experiences, understand how women’s shopping behavior relates to their pathway to the diagnosis of ovarian cancer, and inform research on computational analysis of shopping data for population health. Methods A web-based survey on individuals’ shopping patterns prior to an ovarian cancer diagnosis was analyzed to identify key knowledge about health care purchases. Logistic regression and random forest models were employed to statistically examine how products linked to potential symptoms related to presentation to health care and timing of diagnosis. Results Of the 101 women surveyed with ovarian cancer, 58.4% (59/101) bought nonprescription health care products for up to more than a year prior to diagnosis, including pain relief and abdominal products. General practitioner advice was the primary reason for the purchases (23/59, 39%), with 51% (30/59) occurring due to a participant’s doctor believing their health problems were due to a condition other than ovarian cancer. Associations were shown between purchases made because a participant’s doctor believing their health problems were due to a condition other than ovarian cancer and the following variables: health problems for longer than a year prior to diagnosis (odds ratio [OR] 7.33, 95% CI 1.58-33.97), buying health care products for more than 6 months to a year (OR 3.82, 95% CI 1.04-13.98) or for more than a year (OR 7.64, 95% CI 1.38-42.33), and the number of health care product types purchased (OR 1.54, 95% CI 1.13-2.11). Purchasing patterns are shown to be potentially predictive of a participant’s doctor thinking their health problems were due to some condition other than ovarian cancer, with nested cross-validation of random forest classification models achieving an overall in-sample accuracy score of 89.1% and an out-of-sample score of 70.1%. Conclusions Women in the survey were 7 times more likely to have had a duration of more than a year of health problems prior to a diagnosis of ovarian cancer if they were self-medicating based on advice from a doctor rather than having made the decision to self-medicate independently. Predictive modelling indicates that women in such situations, who are self-medicating because their doctor believes their health problems may be due to a condition other than ovarian cancer, exhibit distinct shopping behaviors that may be identifiable within purchasing data. Through exploratory research combining women sharing their behaviors prior to diagnosis and computational analysis of these data, this study demonstrates that women’s shopping data could potentially be useful for early ovarian cancer detection.",,"carcinoma, ovarian epithelial, ovarian neoplasms, self-medication, diagnostic errors, symptom assessment, machine learning, nonprescription drugs, over-the-counter, pharmaceutical, symptom, ovary, ovarian cancer, oncology, cancer"

This way of thinking highlights the role of memory as an essential resource for observation, and makes it clear that “memory” and “time” are also mutually inter-defined, complementary concepts. We formulate our approach in terms of the Free Energy Principle (FEP) of Friston and colleagues and the fundamental idea from quantum theory that physical interactions can be represented by linear operators. Following Levin (2024) [30], we emphasize that memory is, first and foremost, an interpretative function, from which the idea of memory as a record, at some level of accuracy, of past events is derivative.

In these logics well-formed formulas are supposed to denote pieces of quantum information: possible pure states of quantum systems that can store the information in question. At the same time, the logical connectives are interpreted as quantum logical gates: unitary operators that process quantum information in a reversible way, giving rise to quantum circuits. Quantum computational logics have been mainly studied as sentential logics (whose alphabet consists of atomic sentences and of logical connectives). In this article we propose a semantic characterization for a first-order epistemic quantum computational logic, whose language can express sentences like “Alice knows that everybody knows that she is pretty”. One can prove that (unlike the case of logical connectives) both quantifiers and epistemic operators cannot be generally represented as (reversible) quantum logical gates. The “act of knowing” and the use of universal (or existential) assertions seem to involve some irreversible “theoretic jumps”, which are similar to quantum measurements. Since all epistemic agents are characterized by specific epistemic domains (which contain all pieces of information accessible to them), the unrealistic phenomenon of logical omniscience is here avoided: knowing a given sentence does not imply knowing all its logical consequences.",,"Quantum computation, Quantum computational logics, Epistemic operators"

The in vitro cytotoxic activity of the synthesized compounds was evaluated against three human cancer cell lines (MCF-7, HepG-2 and HCT-116). The IC50 values for compound 17 were 2.61± 0.01, 3.20 ± 0.02, and 2.46 ± 0.01 µM, respectively, compared to sorafenib (4.21±0.03, 3.40 ± 0.02, and 5.30 ± 0.04 µM) against MCF-7, HePG-2, and HCT-116. This indicated that compound 17 possess double strength relative to sorafenib against both MCF-7 and HCT-116. Compound 17 was the most promising VEGFR-2 inhibitor with IC50 value of 0.34 μM that was slightly better than that of sorafenib (0.38 μM). Further studies displayed the ability of compound 17 to arrest the growth of HCT-116 cells at the Pre-G1 and S phases. Additionally, compound 17 induced a significant increase in the total apoptosis rate of HCT-116 cells from 1.82 % to 26.69 %. Moreover, it showed high selectivity indices against HCT-116, HepG2, and MCF-7 cancer cells. Furthermore, compound 17 showed potent inhibitory activities on TNF-α and IL-6 and showed a notable rise in caspase-3 level.

While most studies endeavor to delineate the emotional responses of social media users, there is limited research exploring the factors associated with the emergence of emotions, particularly negative ones, during news consumption. Objective We aim to first depict the web coverage by news organizations on social media and then explore the crucial elements of news coverage that trigger the public’s negative emotions. Our findings can act as a reference for responsible parties and news organizations in times of crisis. Methods We collected 23,705 Facebook posts with 1,019,317 comments from the public pages of representative news organizations in Hong Kong. We used text mining techniques, such as topic models and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, to analyze news components and public reactions. Beyond descriptive analysis, we used regression models to shed light on how news coverage on social media is associated with the public’s negative emotional responses. Results Our results suggest that occurrences of issues regarding pandemic situations, antipandemic measures, and supportive actions are likely to reduce the public’s negative emotions, while comments on the posts mentioning the central government and the Government of Hong Kong reveal more negativeness. Negative and neutral media tones can alleviate the rage and interact with the subjects and issues in the news to affect users’ negative emotions. Post length is found to have a curvilinear relationship with users’ negative emotions. Conclusions This study sheds light on the impacts of various components of news coverage (issues, subjects, media tone, and length) on social media on the public’s negative emotions (anger, fear, and sadness). Our comprehensive analysis provides a reference framework for efficient crisis communication for similar pandemics at present or in the future. This research, although first extending the analysis between the components of news coverage and negative user emotions to the scenario of social media, echoes previous studies drawn from traditional media and its derivatives, such as web newspapers. Although the era of COVID-19 pandemic gradually brings down the curtain, the commonality of this research and previous studies also contributes to establishing a clearer territory in the field of health crises.",,"web news coverage, emotions, social media, Facebook, COVID-19"

We find that banks that are more affected by the introduction of the OLA (1) significantly decrease their overall risk-taking and (2) shift their loan origination toward lower risk, indicating the general effectiveness of the regime change. This effect, however, does (3) not hold for the largest and most systemically important banks.

In contrast, only a few studies used automated language analyses in bipolar disorder. To our knowledge, no previous research compared automated language characteristics of first-episode psychosis (FEP) and bipolar disorder (FEBD) using NLP methods. Methods Our study included 53 FEP, 40 FEBD and 50 healthy control participants who are native Turkish speakers. Speech samples of the participants in the Thematic Apperception Test (TAT) underwent automated generic and part-of-speech analyses, as well as sentence-level semantic similarity analysis based on SBERT. Results Both FEBD and FEP were associated with the use of shorter sentences and increased sentence-level semantic similarity but less semantic alignment with the TAT pictures. FEP also demonstrated reduced verbosity and syntactic complexity. FEP differed from FEBD in reduced verbosity, decreased first-person singular pronouns, fewer conjunctions, increased semantic similarity as well as shorter sentence and word length. The mean classification accuracy was 82.45 % in FEP vs HC, 71.1 % in FEBD vs HC, and 73 % in FEP vs FEBD. After Bonferroni correction, the severity of negative symptoms in FEP was associated with reduced verbal output and increased 5th percentile of semantic similarity. Limitations The main limitation of this study was the cross-sectional nature. Conclusion Our findings demonstrate that both patient groups showed language abnormalities, which were more severe and widespread in FEP compared to FEBD. Our results suggest that NLP methods reveal transdiagnostic linguistic abnormalities in FEP and FEBD.",,"Psychosis, Bipolar, First-episode, Natural language processing, Semantic similarity"

We provide an overview of experimental accounts and formal computational models with respect to two dimensions: interactivity and uncertainty. Thereby, we aim at capturing the nuances of ToM functions in the context of social decision processes. We suggest there to be an increase in ToM engagement and multiplexing as social cognitive decision-making tasks become more interactive and uncertain. We propose that representing others as intentional and goal directed agents who perform consequential actions is elicited only at the edges of these two dimensions. Further, we argue that computational models of valuation and beliefs follow these dimensions to best allow researchers to effectively model sophisticated ToM-processes.

In this paper, authors discussed the lack of tools to computationally support WS handling. In response to this lack, a computational tool was developed considering a previously published method for WS classification based on conceptual systems. This tool was applied and evaluated in experimental cases about surprising events that occurred in politics in recent years, considering traditional metrics of information retrieval. Experiments illustrate that organizations can create several conceptual systems to represent different scenarios and types of knowledge; after all, results showed that the tool can operate according to different artifacts of knowledge representation.

Though the starting barrier is low, fundamental concepts are still required in order to manage the technicalities of the engineering environment and everyday computational systems. In 1967, Logo proposed to teach abstract programming concepts by providing a set of functions that had intuitive, visible effects over a robotic Turtle. LOGO was a success, but the robots quickly migrated into computer simulations. From LOGO, many followed. Scratch and Lego Mindstorm are some of the most notorious examples. Both introduced graphical block-based programming interfaces. We propose to bring back the powerful ideas behind LOGO by updating it with state of the art technologies.

Traditionally, the uncertainty in decision making was handled using expertise collected by individual providers and, more recently, systematic appraisal of research in the form of evidence-based medicine. The traditional approach has been used successfully in medicine for a very long time. However, it has substantial limitations because of the complexity of the system of the human body and healthcare. The complex systems are a network of highly coupled components intensely interacting with each other. These interactions give those systems redundancy and thus robustness to failure and, at the same time, equifinality, that is, many different causative pathways leading to the same outcome. The equifinality of the complex systems of the human body and healthcare system demand the individualization of medical care, medicine, and medical decision making. Computational models excel in modeling complex systems and, consequently, enabling individualization of medical decision making and medicine. Computational models are theory- or knowledge-based models, data-driven models, or models that combine both approaches. Data are essential, although to a different degree, for computational models to successfully represent complex systems. The individualized decision making, made possible by the computational modeling of complex systems, has the potential to revolutionize the entire spectrum of medicine from individual patient care to policymaking. This approach allows applying tests and treatments to individuals who receive a net benefit from them, for whom benefits outweigh the risk, rather than treating all individuals in a population because, on average, the population benefits. Thus, the computational modeling–enabled individualization of medical decision making has the potential to both improve health outcomes and decrease the costs of healthcare.",,"computation, data, data-driven models, machine learning, modeling, physics-based models, theory-based models, uncertainty"

Following the trends in the profession, these various technologies of computer aided drafting, enumerating, modeling, and analysis became not only key pedagogical nodes in the design studio, but also started to shape the overall curricular structure of architectural education as they also needed to be implemented as support courses in order to compensate the learning curves and the number of software available to architects. These digital technologies range from one end of simple drafting, conventional three dimensional modeling, and more sophisticated animation of buildings with a computer, to the other end of inventing new tectonic and spatial geometries using parametric computations. In this context, it will be unrealistic to argue against teaching and using digital technologies in architectural education. When one thinks how the profession has evolved in the past decade, it is necessary to embrace these tools in the architectural curriculum. However, a discussion that has not been clearly resolved is when, where, and how these digital tools are thought and used in the architectural education. My paper argues that the conventional tools of hand drawing, physical modeling, and hand making should be embraced in the foundational levels, and the digital tools should be introduced after developing a certain set of skills of one-to-one physical making where a sense of tectonic resolution, scale, and spatial experience is cultivated as a basis of architectural thinking with digital tools.

While traditional centrifugal puzzles are limited to simple shapes, we propose a computational design method to generalize such puzzles by embedding the mechanical core into 3D models. We parameterize the internal core mechanism and optimize the design under several design constraints, and we generate a support structure that helps users solve puzzles easily because generalized puzzles cannot always be spun steadily and easily due to complex surfaces and non-flat contact areas.

This study aimed to explore the interaction between the structural and functional brain network in AD using advanced structural–functional coupling (S-F coupling) models to assess whether these changes correlate with cognitive function, Aβ deposition levels, and gene expression. In this study, we utilized multimodal magnetic resonance imaging data from 41 individuals with AD, 112 individuals with mild cognitive impairment, and 102 healthy controls to explore these mechanisms. We applied different computational models to examine the changes in the S-F coupling associated with AD. Our results showed that the communication and graph harmonic models demonstrated greater heterogeneity and were more sensitive than the statistical models in detecting AD-related pathological changes. In addition, S-F coupling increases with AD progression at the global, subnetwork, and regional node levels, especially in the medial prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortices. The S-F coupling of these regions also partially mediated cognitive decline and Aβ deposition. Furthermore, gene enrichment analysis revealed that changes in S-F coupling were strongly associated with the regulation of cellular catabolic processes. This study advances our understanding of the interaction between structural and functional connectivity and highlights the importance of S-F coupling in elucidating the neural mechanisms underlying cognitive decline in AD.",,"Structural-functional coupling, Statistical model, Communication model, Graph harmonic model, Brain network, Alzheimer’s disease, Multimodal MRI"

A shift in lncRNA expression between Btt primed larvae and other treatment groups provides evidence of immune memory response. A few “priming” lncRNAs (n = 9) were uniquely regulated in Btt primed larvae. Evidence suggests these lncRNAs are likely controlling immune priming in Tribolium by regulating expression of genes involved in proteasomal machinery, Notch system, zinc metabolism, and methyltransferase activity, which are necessary to modulate phagocytosis.

This cohort-sequential study (N = 841) explored the cognitive processes that underlie in elementary school children’s math computational growth who are monolingual (English-only) or English learners with Spanish as a first language. Three language subgroups (proficient ELs [relatively proficient in both English and Spanish vocabulary], less proficient ELs [more proficient in English when compared to Spanish vocabulary] and monolingual [English-only]) children with and without math difficulties (MD) were compared on measures of math computation and cognitive growth. As expected, children with MD identified at wave 1 underperformed children without MD in their rate of growth and their level of computational and working memory (WM) performance in the final testing wave. However, two additional findings occurred. First, executive processing measures (working memory and inhibition) were significantly related to computational growth even when measures of reading, fluid intelligence, STM, naming speed and SES were partialed in the analysis. Second, no statistical advantages in executive processing or computation emerged in favor of EL children relative to monolingual children. Taken together, the results support the notion that (a) growth in math computation is tied to growth in the executive system and (b) EL children relatively proficient in English and Spanish experience no growth advantages in WM or computation compared to monolingual children.",,"Math difficulties, English learner, Bilingual, Working memory, Cognition, Math computation"

The purpose of these models is to augment the current diagnostic categories that utilize a “snapshot” approach to describing mental states. We hope to convey to researchers and clinicians that non-linear dynamics can provide an additional useful longitudinal framework to understand mental illness. Psychiatric phenomena are complex processes that evolve in time, similar to many other processes in nature that have been successfully described and understood within deterministic chaos and non-linear dynamic computational models. Dynamical models describe mental processes and phenomena that change over time, more like a movie than a photograph, with multiple variables interacting over time. The use of these models may help us understand why and how current diagnostic categories are insufficient. They may also provide a new, more descriptive and ultimately more predictive approach leading to better understanding of the interrelationship between psychological, neurobiological, and genetic underpinnings of mental illness.",,"Phenomenology, Mathematical models, Non-linear dynamics, Winner less competition, Psychopathology"

Cooley and Tukey's Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) from 1964 is a method for computing this transformation in time O(nlog⁡n). From a lower bound perspective, relatively little is known. Ailon shows in 2013 an Ω(nlog⁡n) bound for computing the normalized Fourier Transform assuming only unitary operations on two coordinates are allowed at each step, and no extra memory is allowed. In 2014, Ailon then improved the result to show that, in a κ-well conditioned computation, Fourier computation can be sped up by no more than O(κ). The main conjecture is that Ailon's result can be exponentially improved, in the sense that κ-well condition cannot admit ω(log⁡κ) speedup. The main result here is that ‘algebraic’ κ-well condition cannot admit ω(κ) speedup. One equivalent definition of algebraic condition number is related to the degree of polynomials naturally arising as the computation evolves. Using the maximum modulus theorem from complex analysis, we show that algebraic condition number upper bounds standard condition number, and equals it in certain cases. Algebraic condition number is an interesting measure of numerical computation stability in its own right, and provides a novel computational lens. Moreover, based on evidence from other recent related work, we believe that the approach of algebraic condition number has a good chance of establishing an algebraic version of the main conjecture.",,"Fourier transform, Lower bounds, Complexity, Linear algebraic computation"

We review computational psychiatry in terms of the ambitions of investigators, emerging domains of application, and future work. Our focus is on theoretical formulations of brain function that put subjective beliefs and behaviour within formal (computational) frameworks—frameworks that can be grounded in neurophysiology down to the level of synaptic mechanisms. Understanding the principles that underlie the brain's functional architecture might be essential for an informed phenotyping of psychopathology in terms of its pathophysiological underpinnings. We focus on active (Bayesian) inference and predictive coding. Specifically, we show how basic principles of neuronal computation can be used to explain psychopathology, ranging from impoverished theory of mind in autism to abnormalities of smooth pursuit eye movements in schizophrenia.",,

Their effectiveness depends on the quality of their design. Frameworks for DSG design can guide the creation of engaging games tailored to objectives such as education, health, and social impact. Objective This study aims to review, analyze, and synthesize the literature on digital entertainment game design frameworks and DSG design frameworks (DSGDFWs). The focus is on conceptual frameworks offering high-level guidance for the game creation process rather than component-specific tools. We explore how these frameworks can be applied to create impactful serious games in fields such as health care and education. Key goals include identifying design principles, commonalities, dependencies, gaps, and opportunities in the literature. Suggestions for future research include empathic design thinking, artificial intelligence integration, and iterative improvements. The findings culminate in a synthesized 4-phase design process, offering generic guidelines for designers and developers to create effective serious games that benefit society. Methods A 2-phase methodology was used: a scoping literature review and cluster analysis. A targeted search across 7 databases (ACM, Scopus, Springer, IEEE, Elsevier, JMIR Publications, and SAGE) was conducted using PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) 2020 guidelines. Studies included academic or industry papers evaluating digital game design frameworks. Cluster analysis was applied to categorize the data, revealing trends and correlations among frameworks. Results Of 987 papers initially identified, 25 (2.5%) met the inclusion criteria, with an additional 22 identified through snowballing, resulting in 47 papers. These papers presented 47 frameworks, including 16 (34%) digital entertainment game design frameworks and 31 (66%) DSGDFWs. Thematic analysis grouped frameworks into categories, identifying patterns and relationships between design elements. Commonalities, dependencies, and gaps were analyzed, highlighting opportunities for empathic design thinking and artificial intelligence applications. Key considerations in DSG design were identified and presented in a 4-phase design baseline with the outcome of a list of design guidelines that might, according to the literature, be applied to an end-to-end process of designing and building future innovative solutions. Conclusions The main benefits of using DSGDFWs seem to be related to enhancing the effectiveness of serious games in achieving their intended objectives, such as learning, behavior change, and social impact. Limitations primarily seem to be related to constraints associated with the specific contexts in which the serious games are developed and used. Approaches in the future should be aimed at refining and adapting existing frameworks to different contexts and purposes, as well as exploring new frameworks that incorporate emerging technologies and design principles.",,"entertainment game design frameworks, serious game design frameworks, design principles, empathic design thinking, artificial intelligence"

These computations are based on the Deforming-Spatial-Domain/Stabilized-Space-Time (DSD/SST) finite element formulation. Unsteady flows past a stationary NACA 0012 airfoil are computed for Reynolds numbers 1000, 5000 and 100 000. Significantly different flow patterns are observed for these three cases. The method is then applied to computation of the dynamics of an airfoil falling in a viscous fluid under the influence of gravity. It is observed that the location of the center of gravity of the airfoil plays an important role in determining its pitch stability. Computations are reported also for simulation of the dynamics of a two-dimensional ‘projectile’ that has a certain initial velocity. Specially designed mesh moving schemes are employed to eliminate the need for remeshing. All these computations were carried out on the Thinking Machines CM-200 and CM-5 supercomputers, with major speed-ups compared to traditional supercomputers. The implicit equation systems arising from the finite element discretizations of these large-scale problems are solved iteratively by using the GMRES update technique with diagonal preconditioners.

Because the patient refused an open surgery, a conical TREO CM endograft was manufactured with 20% proximal oversizing, whereas the 3-cm caudal sealing segment demonstrated a conical configuration comprising a 2-cm and 1-cm nitinol-supported zones of 20% and 10% oversizing, respectively, to avoid excessive strain and incomplete expand at the most distal calcified area, leading ultimately to an insidious infolding and consequent type Ib endoleak. A 24 × 40 mm Treovance aortic cuff was centrally deployed resulting in a 30 mm overlap with the main endograft. Results After 6 months, there was complete sealing, and the AAA sac has been shrunk to 45 mm. Conclusions The use of a conical TREO CM endograft with a proximal cuff provides a firm fixation centrally and a sufficient distal sealing design in AAAs with calcified and tight distal aorta, constituting a reliable alternative to bifurcated endografts or aortouniliac configurations followed by crossover adjuncts.",,

The modal approach to create a comprehensive theory of thinking strives to identify simple conditions under which a given type of thinking can be reliably reproduced. Following the successful example of experimenters in many of the natural sciences, the goal of this approach is to discover general laws and invariant constraints in well-defined tasks that do not require access to complex knowledge and experience. The most popular alternative approach to the study of thinking starts by examining performance in everyday life and identifying stable and reproducible phenomena. Of particular interest is expert performance, because it offers the highest levels of performance and also the largest stable individual differences in performance when compared with that of beginners. An understanding of thinking is incomplete unless it provides an account of how the elements of adult thought—such as concepts, representations, and skills—are acquired. Research on learning and skill acquisition on the whole range of activities ranging from performance on simple laboratory tasks to complex life-long efforts to attain expert performance shows that effective learning is not an automatic consequence of extended experience.",Academic Press,

Scientific evidence shows that conceptual development is fundamental for the emergence of high-cognitive phenomena. Here, we model such phenomena in a brain-inspired cognitive robotic model and examine how the robot can learn, categorise, and abstract concepts to voluntary control behaviour. The paper argues that such competence arises with sufficient conceptual content from physical and social experience. Hence, senses, motor abilities and language, all contribute to a robot’s intelligent behaviour. To this aim, we devised a method for attaining concepts, which computationally reproduces the steps of the inductive thinking strategy of the Concept Attainment Model (CAM). Initially, the robot is tutor-guided through socio-centric cues to attain concepts and is then tested consistently to use these concepts to solve complex tasks. We demonstrate how the robot uses language to create new categories by abstraction in response to human language-directed instructions. Linguistic stimuli also change the representations of the robot’s experiences and generate more complex representations for further concepts. Most notably, this work shows that this competence emerges from the robot’s ability to understand the concepts similarly to human understanding. Such understanding was also maintained when concepts were expressed in multilingual lexicalisations showing that labels represent concepts that allowed the model to adapt to unfamiliar contingencies in which it did not have directly related experiences. The work concludes that language is an essential component of conceptual development, which scaffolds the cognitive continuum of a robot from low-to-high cognitive skills, including its skill to understand.",,"Brain-inspired model, Cognitive architecture, Robotic model, High-level cognition, Human language, Concepts, Categorisation, Conceptual development, Understanding"

Sixteen students (9 female) studying university-level computing were asked to explain their understanding of computing concepts (without materials) in individually video-recorded sessions. We analysed the gestures generated for three elementary concepts: algorithms, loops, and conditional statements. In total, 368 representational gestures were identified across 48 (16 × 3) explanations, thereby providing evidence that offline thinking in this domain is embodied. Our analysis of representational gestures showed that participants drew upon two overarching embodied metaphors in their explanations: 1) Computing Constructs as Physical Objects, in which participants simulated manipulating physical objects (e.g., pinching) when referring to range of computing constructs, and 2) Computing Processes as Motion along a Path, whereby participants moved their hands along one of three body-based axes when referring to temporal sequences.

This level of specificity can in turn be beneficial to establish the identity of the corresponding behavioral and neurobiological mechanisms.

This may be due to limited relevant information, lack of creative skills, design fixation, or as a result of too many previously existing ideas. Conventional creativity tools, such as brainstorming and TRIZ, as well as advanced methods, such as design-by-analogy, are often employed by designers for idea generation to alleviate some of these challenges. In recent years, computational creativity tools have emerged to support creative idea generation. However, most of these computational tools are data-driven, and thereby employ various databases, for example, existing databases such as the ConceptNet containing past common-sense knowledge, and customized ones containing limited information. The limitations of these databases have constrained the capability of the computational creativity tools. Social media platforms, such as Twitter and Wikipedia, which allow users to create web-based content, have been reported to have billions of users. It can be considered a huge ‘unorganized’ database of information created by a crowd. However, to date little work has been done on the utilization of such crowd-generated knowledge from social media to support actual design activities, especially during the early stages of the design process. In this paper, the authors propose a computational approach to retrieve, process, and reuse the textual knowledge from social networks to prompt designers’ creative mind in producing ideas for new product design and development. They also propose a novel approach to construct crowd knowledge databases, which can be employed by computational tools, as well as used individually, for supporting creative idea generation. A case study involving the use of an existing social media analysis tool to construct a crowd database for helping designers produce ideas has been conducted to provide insights on implementing the proposed approach for creative idea generation.",,"Creativity, Social Media, Idea Generation, Social Networking, Ideation"

We prove that our amalgam-based category-theoretical model of conceptual blending is essentially equivalent to the pushout model in the ordered category of partial maps as put forward by Goguen.

The field, in general, has made significant progress towards self-tuning database technology, but there is no breakthrough. The biggest challenges that the research community should address as high-priority problems are the interactions of different system components and their tuning knobs, and the interference between different workload classes. For tackling this complexity, it is believed that a drastic simplification of today's overly complex system architectures is overdue.

Most people also believe that deaf people can make a big contribution to society if they receive the right education, and this becomes a challenge for deaf teachers and students. Therefore, this paper aims to find a solution that can become a means of independent education for deaf people. This paper is using design thinking method to achieve the goal. The result of this research is the development of an educational mobile application specifically for the deaf, namely 'V-Voice'. This application provides various learning features, such as; animated videos, education games and texts that are attractively designed. Through 'V-Voice', it is hoped that deaf people can study harder independently and be helped to manage information and develop their soft skills and hard skills.",,"Deaf, Education, Learning features, Mobile application"

Our examples often involve the discussion of cognitive agents in highway traffic models. A cognitive agent is an agent capable of performing cognitive acts, i.e. a sequence of the following activities: “Perceiving” information in the environment and provided by other agents, “Reasoning” about this information using existing knowledge, “Judging” the obtained information using existing knowledge, “Responding” to other cognitive agents or to the external environment, as it may be required, and “Learning”, i.e. changing (and, hopefully augmenting) the existing knowledge if the newly acquired information allows it. We describe how computational intelligence techniques (e.g., fuzzy logic, neural networks, genetic algorithms, etc) allow mimicking to a certain extent the cognitive acts performed by human beings. The order with which the cognitive actions take place is important and so is the order with which the various computational intelligence techniques are applied. We believe that a hierarchical layered model should be defined for the generic cognitive agents in a style akin to the hierarchical OSI 7 layer model used in data communication. We outline in broad sense such a reference model.",,"Agent, Agent modeling, Cognitive agent, Computational intelligence"

The consensus is that these primitive operations include logical operations like conjunction, disjunction and negation, as well as reading and writing to a large collection of memory locations. This perspective conforms to a macro-level view of physics and indeed these operations are realizable using macro-level devices involving thousands of electrons. This point of view is however incompatible with computation realized using quantum devices or analyzed using elementary thermodynamics as both these fundamental physical theories imply that information is a conserved quantity of physical processes and hence of primitive computational operations. Our aim is to redevelop foundational computational models in a way that embraces the principle of conservation of information. We first define what information is and what its conservation means in a computational setting. We emphasize the idea that computations must be reversible transformations on data. One can think of data as modeled using topological spaces and programs as modeled by reversible deformations of these spaces. We then illustrate this idea using three notions of data and their associated reversible computational models. The first instance only assumes unstructured finite data, i.e., discrete topological spaces. The corresponding notion of reversible computation is that of permutations. We show how this simple model subsumes conventional computations on finite sets. We then consider a modern structured notion of data based on the Curry–Howard correspondence between logic and type theory. We develop the corresponding notion of reversible deformations using a sound and complete programming language for witnessing type isomorphisms and proof terms for commutative semirings. We then “move up a level” to examine spaces that treat programs as data, which is a crucial notion for any universal model of computation. To derive the corresponding notion of reversible programs between programs, i.e., reversible program equivalences, we look at the “higher dimensional” analog to commutative semirings: symmetric rig groupoids. The coherence laws for these groupoids turn out to be exactly the sound and complete reversible program equivalences we seek. We conclude with some possible generalizations inspired by homotopy type theory and survey several open directions for further research.",Elsevier,"Reversible programming, Reversible Boolean circuits, Monoidal categories, Type isomorphisms, Commutative semirings, Homotopy-type theory, Quantum circuits, Permutations"

We argue that the answer to this question depends on how numbers are represented, because a representation can do part of the computation. We test, for the first time, whether Bayesian reasoning can be elicited in children by means of natural frequencies. We show that when information was presented to fourth, fifth, and sixth graders in terms of probabilities, their ability to estimate the Bayesian posterior probability was zero. Yet when the same information was presented in natural frequencies, Bayesian reasoning showed a steady increase from fourth to sixth grade, reaching an average level of 19, 39, and 53%, respectively, in two studies. Sixth graders' performance with natural frequencies matched the performance of adults with probabilities. But this general increase was accompanied by striking individual differences. More than half of the sixth graders solved most or all problems, whereas one third could not solve a single one. An analysis of the children's responses provides evidence for the use of three non-Bayesian strategies. These follow an overlapping wave model of development and continue to be observed in the minds of adults. More so than adults' probabilistic reasoning, children's reasoning depends on a proper representation of information.",,"Bayesian problems, Computation, Binary hypothesis"

Although most of the world's population is bilingual, few studies have investigated the effects of language of operation on creative output. This is surprising given that fluent bilinguals master inhibitory control, a mechanism also at play in creative idea evaluation. Here, we compared creative output in the two languages of Polish(L1)-English(L2) bilinguals engaged in a cyclic adaptation of the Alternative Uses Task increasing the contribution of idea evaluation (convergent thinking). We show that Polish-English bilinguals suffer less cognitive interference when generating unusual uses for common objects in the L2 than the L1, without incurring a significant drop in idea originality. Right posterior alpha oscillation power, known to reflect creative thinking, increased over cycles. This effect paralleled the increase in originality ratings over cycles, and lower alpha power (8–10 Hz) was significantly greater in the L1 than the L2. Unexpectedly, we found greater beta (16.5–28 Hz) desynchronization in the L2 than the L1, suggesting that bilingual participants suffered less interference from competing mental representations when performing the task in the L2. Whereas creative output seems unaffected by language of operation overall, the drop in beta power in the L2 suggests that bilinguals are not subjected to the same level of semantic flooding in the second language as they naturally experience in their native language.",,"Creativity, Bilingualism, EEG, Alternate uses task, Alpha frequency, Beta frequency"

Luhmann's and Boulding's perspectives show profit-seeking corporations to be social systems developing high technological complexity at the cost of sacrificing their societal sustainability, while the improvement of the latter constitutes the rationale of many nonprofit organizations.

Should the results provided by these established techniques always be so readily accepted given the range of assumptions on which they are based? Current meter gauging is the principle technique used for the establishment of stage discharge relationships in the UK. Either directly for the establishment of stage-discharge relationships in open channels, indirectly for calibration of flow measurement equipment (e.g. ultrasonic Doppler velocity meters) or as a means of verification of existing flow measurement structures. Recent projects involving current meter gauging techniques have provoked much thought as to the validity of established techniques and in particular the assumptions on which they are based. The chosen case studies highlight a number of projects where there have been questions regarding the reliability and uncertainty of the flow measurement techniques employed. The alternative approaches required to deal with such problems are also discussed.",,"flow measurement, current meter gauging, flow measurement structures, calibration, stage-discharge relationship"

The resultant spatial bodies are thus visualised as complex adaptive systems, continually engaged in activities of data-exchange resulting in physical and ambient adaptations of their constituting components in response to contextual variations. Interdependent nodal networks, where every node/junction of a spatial prototype becomes a potential information hub by means of its ability to collect, process and communicate contextual data apart from working as an actuated detail owing to its ability to kinetically re-position itself in three-dimensional space is thus a critical outcome of this inter-disciplinary way of working.

However, researchers usually study these two tasks separately. In addition, we argue that previous studies still overlook the importance of human thinking patterns. To enhance the development of PLMs for CTEC, inspired by humans’ daily error-correcting behavior, we propose a novel model-agnostic progressive learning framework, named ProTEC, which guides PLMs-based CTEC models to learn to correct like humans and can be applied to various existing CTEC models in both CSC and CGEC. During the training process, ProTEC guides the model to learn text error correction by incorporating these sub-tasks into a progressive paradigm. During the inference process, the model completes these sub-tasks in turn to generate the correction results.

The existing or traditional computational design optimization (CDO) approaches mostly focus on optimization problem solving (OPS), as they often conduct optimizations directly by assuming the optimization problems in question are good enough. In contrast, the computational design exploration (CDE) approaches defined in this research mainly focus on optimization problem formulation (OPF), which are considered more essential and aim to achieve or ensure appropriate optimization problems before conducting optimizations. However, the application of the CDE is very limited especially in conceptual architectural design. The necessity of re-formulating original optimization problems and its potential impacts on optimization results are often overlooked or not emphasized enough. This paper proposes a new CDE approach that highlights the knowledge-supported re-formulation of a changeable initial optimization problem. It improves upon the traditional CDO approach by introducing a changeable initial OPF and inserting a CDE module. The changeable initial OPF allows expanding the dimensionality of an objective space and design space being investigated, and the CDE module can re-formulate the changeable optimization problem using the information and knowledge extracted from statistical analyses. To facilitate designers in achieving the proposed approach, an improved computational platform is used which combines parametric modeling software (including simulation plug-ins) and design optimization software. Assisted by the platform, the proposed approach is applied to the conceptual design of an indoor sports building that considers multi-disciplinary performance criteria (including architecture-, climate- and structure-related criteria) and a wide range of geometric variations. Through the case study, this paper demonstrates the use of the proposed approach, verifies its benefits over the traditional method, and unveils the factors that may affect the behaviour of the proposed approach. Besides, it also shows the suitability of the computational platform used.",,"Multi-disciplinary optimization, Multi-objective optimization, Computational design exploration, Knowledge extraction, Statistical analysis techniques, Optimization problem re-formulation, Sports buildings, Architectural performance, Climate performance, Structural performance"

We contrasted these competing hypotheses by characterizing the brain activity of CB and sighted participants while performing subtraction, multiplication and a control letter task. In both groups, subtraction selectively activated a bilateral dorsal network commonly activated during spatial processing. Multiplication triggered activity in temporal regions thought to participate in memory retrieval. No between-group difference was observed for the multiplication task whereas subtraction induced enhanced activity in the right dorsal occipital cortex of the blind individuals only. As this area overlaps with regions showing selective tuning to auditory spatial processing and exhibits increased functional connectivity with a dorsal “spatial” network, our results suggest that the recruitment of occipital regions during high-level cognition in the blind actually relates to the intrinsic computational role of the activated regions.",,"Blindness, Mental arithmetic, Multiplication, Neural correlates, Subtraction"

A model of conscious attention based on the theory of dynamic core hypothesis is first outlined, followed by a computational model that mimics key stages of the conscious attention process. Convolutional neural networks serve as a basis for modeling perceptual categorization and concept formation through automatic feature extraction, due to their analogy with the processes of neural group selection and reentry in the brain. Further, the process of incremental learning and its impact on signal novelty are modeled via transfer learning. The model is tested on the NASA C-MAPSS turbofan engine model, which indicated 95–99% fault diagnosis accuracy.

Future advancements in injury prevention depend on improved physical and computational models, which are predicated on a better understanding of the neck response during dynamic loading. Previous studies have shown that the tolerance of the neck is dependent on its initial position and its buckling behavior. This study uses a computational model to examine three important factors hypothesized to influence the loads experienced by vertebrae in the neck under compressive impact: muscle activation, torso constraints, and pre-flexion angle of the cervical spine. Since cadaver testing is not practical for large scale parametric analyses, these factors were studied using a previously validated computational model. On average, simulations with active muscles had 32% larger compressive forces and 25% larger shear forces—well in excess of what was expected from the muscle forces alone. In the short period of time required for neck injury, constraints on torso motion increased the average neck compression by less than 250N. The pre-flexion hypothesis was tested by examining pre-flexion angles from neutral (0°) to 64°. Increases in pre-flexion resulted in the largest increases in peak loads and the expression of higher-order buckling modes. Peak force and buckling modality were both very sensitive to pre-flexion angle. These results validate the relevance of prior cadaver models for neck injury and help explain the wide variety of cervical spine fractures that can result from ostensibly similar compressive loadings. They also give insight into the mechanistic differences between burst fractures and lower cervical spine dislocations.",,"Biomechanics, Cervical spine, Bilateral facet Dislocation, Buckling, Muscle, Initial conditions, Compression, Pre-flexion, Preflexion, Alignment"

Neurophysiological investigations of backward masking show that the threshold for conscious visual perception may be set to be higher than the level at which small but significant information is present in neuronal firing and which allows humans to guess which stimulus was shown without conscious awareness. The adaptive value of this may be that the systems in the brain that implement the type of information processing involved in conscious thoughts are not interrupted by small signals that could be noise in sensory pathways. I then consider what computational processes are closely related to conscious processing, and describe a higher order syntactic thought (HOST) computational theory of consciousness. It is argued that the adaptive value of higher order thoughts is to solve the credit assignment problem that arises if a multistep syntactic plan needs to be corrected. It is then suggested that it feels like something to be an organism that can think about its own linguistic, and semantically-based thoughts. It is suggested that qualia, raw sensory and emotional feels, arise secondarily to having evolved such a higher order thought system, and that sensory and emotional processing feels like something because it would be unparsimonious for it to enter the planning, higher order thought, system and not feel like something.",,"Consciousness, Higher order thought, Synchrony, Oscillations, Backward masking, Binding"

There are several efforts around the globe to implement coding frameworks for children, and there is a need to develop an empirical knowledge base of methods and tools. One major problem for integrating study results into a common body of knowledge is the relatively limited measurements applied, and the relation of the widely used self-reporting methods with more objective measurements, such as biophysical ones. In this study, eye-tracking activity was used to measure children’s learning and activity indicators. The goal of the study is to utilize eye-tracking to understand children’s activity while they learn how to code and to investigate any potential association between children’s attitudes and their gaze. In this contribution, we designed an experiment with 44 children (between 8 and 17 years old) who participated in a full-day construction-based coding activity. We recorded their gaze while they were working and captured their attitudes in relation to their learning, excitement and intention. The results showed a significant relation between children’s attitudes (what they think about coding) and their gaze patterns (how they behaved during coding). Eye-tracking data provide initial insights into the behaviour of children, for example if children have difficulty in extracting information or fail to accomplish an expected task. Therefore, further studies need to be conducted to shed additional light on children’s experience and learning duringcoding.",,"Children’s attitudes, Eye-tracking, Coding, Computational thinking, Constructionism"

Consequently, research draws no conclusive picture which of these afore-mentioned processes drives the SVF impairment in AD and MCI. This study uses a qualitative computational approach—combining temporal and semantic information—to investigate exploitation and exploration patterns as indicators for semantic memory retrieval and executive control processes. Audio SVF recordings of 20 controls (C, 66–81 years), 55 MCI (57–94 years) and 20 AD subjects (66–82 years) were assessed while groups were matched according to age and education.

In order to tackle the issue, we at first describe a striking correlation between Wittgenstein's Tractatus, that assesses the syntactic relationships between language and world, and Perlovsky's joint language-cognitive computational model, that assesses the semantic relationships between emotions and “knowledge instinct”. Once established a correlation between a purely logical approach to the language and computable psychological activities, we aim to find the neural correlates of syntax and semantics in the human brain. Starting from topological arguments, we suggest that the semantic properties of a proposition are processed in higher brain's functional dimensions than the syntactic ones. In a fully reversible process, the syntactic elements embedded in Broca's area project into multiple scattered semantic cortical zones. The presence of higher functional dimensions gives rise to the increase in informational content that takes place in semantic expressions. Therefore, diverse features of human language and cognitive world can be assessed in terms of both the logic armor described by the Tractatus, and the neurocomputational techniques at hand. One of our motivations is to build a neuro-computational framework able to provide a feasible explanation for brain's semantic processing, in preparation for novel computers with nodes built into higher dimensions.",,"Borsuk-ulam, Brouwer, Computation, Meaning, Truth, Syntactic"

Basic strategies used to solve this problem, i.e., the possibilistic method and the least squares method, together with their extensions, have some drawbacks. The possibilistic methods put emphasis on an inclusion property while the least squares methods focus on a central tendency property. Therefore, many researchers work on combining these two methods to obtain a better performance. In this paper, in contrast to most existing techniques which treat fuzzy linear regression as an optimization problem, we set the problem of constructing a fuzzy linear regression model in Bayesian statistics and propose a new fuzzy linear regression method based on approximate Bayesian computation (ABC). The method applies the likelihood-free inference algorithm ABC to generate independent samples of unknown model coefficients from Bayesian posterior distribution. This overcomes difficulty of defining likelihood function in fuzzy environment. By adjusting a prior distribution and a threshold of the ABC algorithm, the proposed approach can flexibly balance the inclusion property of the possibilistic methods and the central tendency property of the least squares methods. The convergence property of the proposed ABC algorithm is verified by a numerical example. Two measuring criteria, i.e., a distance metric and a degree of fitting index, which indicate the central tendency property and the inclusion property, respectively, are introduced to evaluate the quality of regression results. Three numerical examples are applied to show the performances of the proposed method. The numerical results are also compared with those obtained by some classical and recently proposed approaches. Additionally, a practical engineering application example is used to illustrate effectiveness of the proposed method.",,"Fuzzy linear regression, Bayes statistics, Approximate Bayesian computation"

In this paper, we present the concept of Constraint Local Principal Curve (CLPC), which uses local optimization methods and restricts the principal curve with two fixed endpoints to reduce the computational complexity. In addition, we propose three CLPC algorithms by Local Optimization and Adaptive Radius to expand the range of applications and increase the solution quality. The first algorithm, i.e., CLPCg is based on greedy thinking. The second algorithm, i.e., CLPCs uses one dimensional search and the last algorithm CLPCc combines the greedy thinking and one dimensional search. Then, we define six performance indices to evaluate the performance of the CLPC algorithms. Finally, we present some numerical experiments with three simulation data sets and two GPS measured data sets in both highway and railway. The results indicate that all of the three CLPC algorithms can obtain high-accuracy data from multiple low-accuracy data efficiently. The CLPC algorithms can improve the accuracy and computational speed compared with the existing K-segment principal curve (KPC) algorithm. In addition, CLPCc outperforms CLPCg and CLPCs according to the comprehensive experiments while CLPCg runs much faster than other ones.",,"Constraint local principal curve (CLPC), GPS, Local optimization, Adaptive radius, Principal of nearest neighbor"

It is therefore argued that students should learn about AI, although it is debated exactly how it should be applied in education. AI literacy has been suggested as a way of defining competencies for students to acquire to meet a future everyday- and working life with AI. This study argues that researchers and educators need a framework for integrating AI literacy into technological literacy, where the latter is viewed as a multiliteracy. This study thus aims to critically analyse and discuss different components of AI literacy found in the literature in relation to technological literacy. The data consists of five AI literacy frameworks related to three traditions of technological knowledge: technical skills, technological scientific knowledge, and socio-ethical technical understanding. The results show that AI literacy for technology education emphasises technological scientific knowledge (e.g., knowledge about what AI is, how to recognise AI, and systems thinking) and socio-ethical technical understanding (e.g., AI ethics and the role of humans in AI). Technical skills such as programming competencies also appear but are less emphasised. Implications for technology education are also discussed, and a framework for AI literacy for technology education is suggested.",,"AI literacy, Ethical issues, AI in education"

Research in Mathematics Education looks for ways to make mathematics education less dry and more attractive. When solving polynomial equations of the first degree, it is very common for teachers to work with the mistaken idea of “changing the sign” when “moving” the member. To minimize this problem, a balance can be used to illustrate the idea of equilibrium and also properties of equality. The objectives of this study were (1) develop a computational tool to replace a conventional balance in practical mathematics exercises thereby solving two material challenges for Brazilian teachers: verifying the accuracy of balances and the lack of student physical and social activity through direct participation; (2) determine how substituting the conventional balance with a computational tool for the solution of first degree polynomial equations affected the aspects inherent in the learning process like motivation, cooperation, dialogue, discussion, reflection, reciprocity, negotiation and responsibility. The results indicate that the cognitive computational tool met the challenges of Brazilian teachers. First, because it lacks mechanisms that need to be verified for accuracy in order to demonstrate equilibrium. Second, because it allows the direct participation of students (physical experience) and the use of the tool in small groups (social experience). The hands on completion of the activity, realistic appearance, the interaction with the tool, visual feedback on the panel, and two students using the same tool awakened motivation, responsibility for completing the activity, dialogue, cooperation, discussion and reflection. Doing the experiment with others aroused concern about the learning of others and reciprocity of knowledge for the improvement of the procedure to be constructed for solving 1st degree equations.",,"Elementary education, Improving classroom teaching, Interactive learning environments, Virtual reality"

Some of the computationally most challenging flow problems, such as fluid–object and fluid–structure interactions as well as free-surface and two-fluid flows, belong to this class. In the development of the methods targeting this class of problems, the computational challenges involved need to be addressed in such a way that 3D computation of complex applications can be carried out efficiently on parallel computers. This requirement has to be one of the key factors in designing various components of the overall solution approach, such as solution techniques for the discretized equations and mesh update methods for handling the changes in the spatial domain occupied by the fluid.

We have conducted semi-structured open-ended research interviews with 17 dermatologists to understand what they expect from an AI application to deliver to medical diagnosis. We have found four aggregate dimensions along which the thinking of dermatologists can be described: the ways in which our participants chose to interact with AI, responsibility, ‘explainability’, and the new way of thinking (mindset) needed for working with AI. We believe that our findings will help physicians who might consider using AI in their diagnosis to understand how to use AI beneficially.

On the commercial front, Internet search suggested that numerous AI-equipped HVAC products have been launched. These products apply AI in very different ways, and their energy-saving effects are also different. Such divergence and uncertain energy-saving effects may hinder AI application. To overcome this difference and accelerate the development of AI applications, the present study proposed a double diamond preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA) method—an analysis method that combined literature review with design thinking. Through a process of divergence-convergence-re-divergence, this study described how to design AI functions for energy-efficient HVAC systems, taking into account more than 1,700 research papers it had reviewed. However, there was a limitation on the part re-divergence.

Instead, this study collected raw data from 88 research papers and used these data to analyze the effectiveness and ineffectiveness of AI in depth.

We focus on links between the equation-free approach and tools from systems and control theory (design of experiments, data analysis, estimation, identification and feedback). As our illustrative example, we choose a specific numerical task (the detection of stability boundaries in parameter space) for stochastic models of two simplified heterogeneous catalytic reaction mechanisms. In the equation-free framework the stochastic simulator is treated as an experiment (albeit a computational one). Short bursts of fine scale simulation (short computational experiments) are designed, executed, and their outputs processed and fed back to the process, in integrated protocols aimed at performing the particular coarse-grained task (the detection of a macroscopic instability). Two distinct approaches are presented; one is a direct translation of our previous protocol for adaptive detection of instabilities in laboratory experiments [Rico-Martinez, R., Krisher, K., Flatgen, G., Anderson, J.

The computational architecture of cortex, for example, is very similar from one area to another and the types, arrangements, and connections of cortical neurons are highly stereotyped. This supports the idea that each cortical area conducts calculations using similarly structured neuronal modules: what we term canonical computational motifs. In addition, the remarkable self-similarity of the brain observables at the micro-, meso- and macro-scale further suggests that these motifs are repeated at increasing spatial and temporal scales supporting brain activity from primary motor and sensory processing to higher-level behaviour and cognition. Here, we briefly review the biological bases of canonical brain circuits and the role of inhibitory interneurons in these computational elements. We then elucidate how canonical computational motifs can be repeated across spatial and temporal scales to build a multiplexing information system able to encode and transmit information of increasing complexity. We point to the similarities between the patterns of activation observed in primary sensory cortices by use of electrophysiology and those observed in large scale networks measured with fMRI. We then employ the canonical model of brain function to unify seemingly disparate evidence on the pathophysiology of schizophrenia in a single explanatory framework.

Regrettable substitutions have been observed in various functional classes, such as flame retardants, where initial solutions aimed at enhancing fire safety but have raised concerns about persistent environmental pollution and potential health risks. Regrettable substitutions are often caused by a lack of data about hazard or exposure, life-cycle considerations or a failure to consider other functionality more broadly. Initial solutions aimed at enhancing fire safety, product performance or crop protection have ended up raising new concerns about persistent environmental pollution, ecosystem effects, occupational hazards and long-term health risks. To avoid future regrettable substitutions, a more holistic, data-driven approach to chemical alternatives assessment is needed. This should incorporate human-relevant mechanistic toxicity testing, quantitative exposure modeling, life cycle thinking, and consideration of safer chemistry solutions that maintain product functionality. Enhanced cross-sector collaboration, data sharing, and clear risk communication to consumers is also critical.

The best characterized cadherins are the vertebrate ‘classical’ cadherins, which mediate adhesion via trans homodimerization between their membrane-distal EC1 domains that extend from apposed cells, and assemble intercellular adherens junctions through cis clustering. To form mature trans adhesive dimers, cadherin domains from apposed cells dimerize in a ‘strand-swapped’ conformation. This occurs in a two-step binding process involving a fast-binding intermediate called the ‘X-dimer’. Trans dimers are less flexible than cadherin monomers, a factor that drives junction assembly following cell–cell contact by reducing the entropic cost associated with the formation of lateral cis oligomers.

Terror Management Theory, in parallel, postulates that mortality salience mobilizes these resources to suppress thoughts of death out of focal attention. Consequently, we predicted that individuals under mortality salience would be less likely to give utilitarian responses to moral conflicts. Two experiments corroborated this hypothesis. Experiment 1 showed that utilitarian responses to non-lethal harm conflicts were less frequent when participants were reminded of their mortality. Experiment 2 showed that the detrimental effect of mortality salience on utilitarian conflict judgments was comparable to that of an extreme concurrent cognitive load. These findings raise the question of whether private judgment and public debate about controversial moral issues might be shaped by mortality salience effects, since these issues (e.g., assisted suicide) often involve matters of life and death.",,"Mortality salience, Moral judgment, Utilitarian responses, Cognitive resources"

Methods ChatGPT was prompted with questions from CAMRT practice exams in the disciplines of radiological technology, magnetic resonance (MRI), nuclear medicine and radiation therapy (87-98 questions each). ChatGPT attempted each exam five times. Exam performance was evaluated using descriptive statistics, stratified by discipline and question type (knowledge, application, critical thinking). Light's Kappa was used to assess agreement in answers across attempts. Results Using a passing grade of 65 %, ChatGPT passed the radiological technology exam only once (20 %), MRI all five times (100 %), nuclear medicine three times (60 %), and radiation therapy all five times (100 %). ChatGPT's performance was best on knowledge questions across all disciplines except radiation therapy. It performed worst on critical thinking questions. Agreement in ChatGPT's responses across attempts was substantial within the disciplines of radiological technology, MRI, and nuclear medicine, and almost perfect for radiation therapy. Conclusion ChatGPT (GPT-4) was able to pass certification style exams for radiation technologists and therapists, but its performance varied between disciplines. The algorithm demonstrated substantial to almost perfect agreement in the responses it provided across multiple exam attempts. Future research evaluating ChatGPT's performance on standardized tests should consider using repeated measures. RÉSUMÉ Contexte L'objectif de cette étude était de décrire la compétence du ChatGPT (GPT-4) dans les examens d'agrément de l'Association canadienne des technologues en radiation médicale (ACTRM), et de décrire sa performance à travers plusieurs tentatives d'examen. Méthodes ChatGPT a été invité à répondre à des questions provenant des examens pratiques de l'ACTRM dans les disciplines de la technologie de radiologie, de la résonance magnétique (IRM), de la médecine nucléaire et de la radiothérapie (87-98 questions pour chaque discipline). ChatGPT a tenté chaque examen cinq fois. La performance à l'examen a été évaluée à l'aide de statistiques descriptives, stratifiées par discipline et par type de question (connaissances, application, réflexion critique). Le Kappa de Light a été utilisé pour évaluer la concordance des réponses entre les tentatives. Résultats En utilisant une note de passage de 65 %, ChatGPT a réussi l'examen de technologie de radiologie une seule fois (20 %), l'IRM les cinq fois (100 %), la médecine nucléaire trois fois (60 %), et la radiothérapie les cinq fois (100 %). Les performances de ChatGPT ont été les meilleures pour les questions de connaissances dans toutes les disciplines, à l'exception de la radiothérapie. Il a été le moins performant pour les questions de réflexion critique. La concordance des réponses du ChatGPT entre les tentatives était substantielle dans les disciplines de la technologie de radiologie, de l'IRM et de la médecine nucléaire, et presque parfaite pour la radiothérapie. Conclusion ChatGPT (GPT-4) a été capable de réussir les examens d'agrément pour les technologues en radiation médicale et les radiothérapeutes, mais ses performances ont varié selon les disciplines. L'algorithme a démontré une concordance substantielle à presque parfaite dans les réponses qu'il a fournies à travers de multiples tentatives d'examen. Les futures recherches évaluant les performances de ChatGPT sur des tests standardisés devraient envisager l'utilisation de mesures répétées.",,"Radiography, Radiotherapy, Nuclear Medicine, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, AI (Artificial Intelligence), Natural Language Processing, Teaching, Educational Measurement"

However, f-element–diphosphonioalkylidene complexes can be represented by several resonance forms that render their metal–carbon double bond status unclear. Here, we report an experimentally-validated 13C Nuclear Magnetic Resonance computational assessment of two cerium(iv)–diphosphonioalkylidene complexes, [Ce(BIPMTMS)(ODipp)2] (, BIPMTMS = {C(PPh2NSiMe3)2}2−; Dipp = 2,6-diisopropylphenyl) and [Ce(BIPMTMS)2] (). Decomposing the experimental alkylidene chemical shifts into their corresponding calculated shielding (σ) tensor components verifies that these complexes exhibit CeC double bonds. Strong magnetic coupling of CeC σ/π* and π/σ* orbitals produces strongly deshielded σ11 values, a characteristic hallmark of alkylidenes, and the largest 13C chemical shift tensor spans of any alkylidene complex to date (, 801 ppm; , 810 ppm). In contrast, the phosphonium-substituent shielding contributions are much smaller than the CeC σ- and π-bond components. This study confirms significant Ce 4f-orbital contributions to the CeC bonding, provides further support for a previously proposed inverse-trans-influence in , and reveals variance in the 4f spin–orbit contributions that relate to the alkylidene hybridisation. This work thus confirms the metal–carbon double bond credentials of f-element–diphosphonioalkylidenes, providing quantified benchmarks for understanding diphosphonioalkylidene bonding generally.",,

In such cases, there is typically a simplification in choosing the parameters of the analysis, in the sense that no embedding in multidimensional space is usually assumed and that recurrence is restricted to exact matching (equivalence) of the numerically coded categories. However, such a simplified parameterization brings about some notable changes in the appearance of the obtained Recurrence Plots, which has consequences for the extraction of the standard dynamical measures. Specifically, a categorical Recurrence Plot is often composed of rectangular structures rather than line structures (diagonal and horizontal/vertical), over which the recurrence quantification measures were originally proposed. Starting from this observation, I consider alternative computational procedures to extract a non-biased measure of entropy for the categorical case, showing the viability of such a choice with simulated data",,"Recurrence Quantification Analysis, Entropy, Categorical time series, Dynamical measures, Recurrence Plot"

In these signed systems, there exist functional imbalances from the system-level view because of the existence of unbalanced interactions. However, it is difficult to compute the unbalance degree and transform unbalanced factors to balanced ones in real signed systems. Earlier studies tackled these two issues separately and gave a unique solution, and thus cannot be well applied to real applications with constraints. In this paper, we devise a decomposition-based and network-specific multi-objective optimization algorithm to solve the balance computation and transformation of signed networks simultaneously. The devised algorithm aims at finding a set of optimal balance transformation solutions, and each of which is the trade-off between the twin objectives (i.e., the minimization of inter-cluster positive links and the minimization of intra-cluster negative links). Of these solutions, the one with the fewest unbalanced links corresponds to the solution to the balance computation. And each trade-off solution corresponds to an optimal balance transformation way under a certain transformation cost. Extensive experiments on four social networks demonstrate the effectiveness of the devised algorithm on both the computation and the transformation of structural balance. They also show that the devised algorithm can provide multiple optimal solutions at the same transformation cost.",,"Structural balance computation, Balance transformation, Multi-objective optimization, Decomposition, Signed networks"

The datasets were analyzed separately, and then we compared the obtained results. For this purpose, we applied a genetic correlation analysis to genome-wide association datasets and revealed different genetic correlations with several human traits and diseases.

Commonly used models include SNP BLUP with extensions (BayesA, etc), genomic BLUP (GBLUP) and single-step GBLUP (ssGBLUP). These models are applied for genomewide association studies (GWAS), genomic prediction and parameter estimation. Solving methods include finite Cholesky decomposition possibly with a sparse implementation, and iterative Gauss–Seidel (GS) or preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG), the last two methods possibly with iteration on data. Details are provided that can drastically decrease some computations. For SNP BLUP especially with sampling and large number of SNP, the only choice is GS with iteration on data and adjustment of residuals. If only solutions are required, PCG by iteration on data is a clear choice. A genomic relationship matrix (GRM) has limited dimensionality due to small effective population size, resulting in infinite number of generalized inverses of GRM for large genotyped populations. A specific inverse called APY requires only a small fraction of GRM, is sparse and can be computed and stored at a low cost for millions of animals. With APY inverse and PCG iteration, GBLUP and ssGBLUP can be applied to any population. Both tools can be applied to GWAS. When the system of equations is sparse but contains dense blocks, a recently developed package for sparse Cholesky decomposition and sparse inversion called YAMS has greatly improved performance over packages where such blocks were treated as sparse. With YAMS, GREML and possibly single-step GREML can be applied to populations with >50 000 genotyped animals.

It turns out that such a decision structure can be qualified using the context change arrow as a disruptive process or as a phase transition according to the geometrical representation of computational contexts as double S-curves. In particular a computational context is always characterized by a shift between sense making and temporal causality. That is, once a causal break occurs, it has to be filled locally by a decision. A causal break is always continuous and never discrete; in effect, in the discrete case, combinatoric analysis causes unwanted complexity due to a lack of knowledge, whereas we need full knowledge thanks to a very precise semantic of a causal break. Intuitively, rather than separating brutally models and counter-models as a proof can do by setting a strong negation operator, we prefer to use the continuous inference as an implementation of sense making. Sense is that way taken as the rationality of the transition. Full knowledge requires a special structure, a Hopf algebra in which the continuous property we cannot implement is replaced by the computable co-continuous property in the co-algebraic component of the decision Hopf algebra. We hope that thanks to co-continuous structures and to co-dimensional exterior algebras, we’ll be able to find out a representation of the continuous inference able to compute a decision rather than admitting definitely and desperately that “such a mechanism is totally out of bounds” and will never ever concern a machine.",Academic Press,"Human/machine sense making, Knowledge processing, Decision mechanism, Causal break, Hopf algebras, Computational contexts, Continuous inference"

We discuss the standards used by the curators of these databases for what counts as reliable evidence, acceptable terminology, appropriate experimental set-ups and adequate materials (e.g., specimens). On the one hand, these choices are informed by the collaborative research ethos characterising most model organism communities. On the other hand, the deployment of these standards in databases reinforces this ethos and gives it concrete and precise instantiations by shaping the skills, practices, values and background knowledge required of the database users.

The present work engaged a novel target of addiction, Reinforcer Pathology, in two studies to test changes in behavior among individuals with cocaine use disorder. Methods In Study 1, n = 44 participants engaged the temporal window with episodic future thinking (EFT), a positive prospection exercise. Changes in temporal view and cocaine valuation were tested using delay discounting and behavioral economic demand, respectively. Additionally, a computational model assessed the relative reliance on the near- and far-sighted systems during EFT. In Study 2, n = 71 engaged the temporal window with a negatively-valenced hurricane scenario to test the opposite effects on window length and cocaine valuation. Results Results demonstrated systematic and symmetrical engagement of the behavioral target. Study 1 robustly replicated previous work, wherein EFT lengthened the temporal window and decreased cocaine valuation. Moreover, EFT increased the weighting of the modeled far-sighted system, increasing the relative impact of long-term discounting decisions. Study 2 produced opposite outcomes, shortened temporal window and increased cocaine valuation. Conclusions This approximately equal and opposite reaction to the manipulations supports reinforcer pathology theory and implicates the temporal window over which rewards are valued as a target to be pushed and pulled to produce clinically meaningful behavior change. Using the Experimental Medicine Approach as a guide, future work should identify new potential interventions to engage reinforcer pathology and use the clinically relevant outcomes as a litmus test for mechanism.",,"Reinforcer pathology, Experimental medicine approach, Episodic future thinking, Delay discounting, Behavioral economic demand, Cocaine use disorder"

Several computational toxicology model datasets from past publications were used to compare Bayesian and Support Vector Machine (SVM) learning methods. Results: The increasing amounts of data for defined toxicology endpoints have enabled machine learning models that have been increasingly used for predictions. It is shown that across many different models Bayesian and SVM perform similarly based on cross validation data. Discussion: Considerable progress has been made in computational toxicology in a decade in both model development and availability of larger scale or ‘big data’ models.

The study of animal behavior or behavior biology has been one of the major contributors for this convergence. Behavior is fascinating because it is the response of an organism to internal and external signals and it is controlled by complex interactions among nerves, the sensory and the motor systems. To some extent, behavior is similar to the output (or response) of a computer system or a network node if we consider an animal brain as a computer node.

I sets three objectives in this ‘cognition’ part: (i) to present a brief overview on the literature of behavior biology for computer scientists; (ii) to summarize the state-of-the-art studies in several cognitive aspects of animal behavior: focusing on emerging research in cognitive ecology, social learning and innovation, as well as animal logics; (iii) to review some important existing studies inspired by animal behavior and further present a perspective on the future research. These cognition-related topics offer insights for research fields such as machine learning, human computer interactions (HCI), brain computer interfaces (BCIs), evolutionary computing, pervasive computing, etc. In perspective, I suggest that the interaction between behavioral biology and computer science should be bidirectional, and a new subject, behavioral informatics, or more general computational behavior biology, should be developed by the cooperative efforts between biologists and computer scientists.",,"Animal cognition, Cognitive ecology, Social learning, Bioinspired computing and communication, Behavioral informatics, Computational behavior biology"

As a paradigm, gamified tourism provides a rationale and a setting within which to apply computational economics to tourism, an approach amounting to tourism computability. Algorithmic destinations serve as “petri dishes” for real destinations. Utilizing rule sets that embody destination growth dynamics and visitor behavioural norms, seeding points in a cellular automata model (CA) were grown into algorithmic destinations. This is followed by a morphological transformation of geo-tagged satellite images into spatial points. The overlap of this additive and subtractive approach is at the core of tourism computability. Finally, the spatio-temporal dynamics of economic resilience was traced out through a visual phenomenology of algorithmic destinations. The gamification of tourism should be embraced as it holds up a flicker of hope for mature destinations, amidst the onset of museumification and increased commoditization of heritage sites. Gamification is treated as part of the reflexive cycle for destination authenticity; a notion that that Cohen (1988) alluded to in his discussion of emergent authenticity in destination image formation. Seen in this light, the museumification of Venice and the proliferation of its simulacrum, such as the Venetian Hotel in Macao and Venice-themed hotels across the globe, are prefigures and archetypes of a glorious age of gamified tourism.",,"gamified tourism, algorithmic destinations, simulacrum, computational economics, tourism computability, reflexivity"

However, common scale-based clinical assessment methods are highly subjective and dependent on the neurologist's expertise. Alternate automated methods for arising-from-chair assessment can be established based on quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) images with multiple-instance learning. However, performance stability for such methods can be typically undermined by the presence of irrelevant or spuriously-relevant features that mask the intrinsic causal features. Therefore, we propose a QSM-based arising-from-chair assessment method using a causal graph-neural-network framework, where counterfactual and debiasing strategies are developed and integrated into this framework for capturing causal features. Specifically, the counterfactual strategy is proposed to suppress irrelevant features caused by background noise, by producing incorrect predictions when dropping causal parts. The debiasing strategy is proposed to suppress spuriously relevant features caused by the sampling bias and it comprises a resampling guidance scheme for selecting stable instances and a causal invariance constraint for improving stability under various interferences. The results of extensive experiments demonstrated the superiority of the proposed method in detecting arising-from-chair abnormalities. Its clinical feasibility was further confirmed by the coincidence between the selected causal features and those reported in earlier medical studies. Additionally, the proposed method was extensible for another motion task of leg agility. Overall, this study provides a potential tool for automated arising-from-chair assessment in PD patients, and also introduces causal counterfactual thinking in medical image analysis.

Design is a creative occupation, and good designers are creative people. One of the most vexing and perennial questions in design education concerns the balance between the free, open-ended, and expressive work demanded of the student and attention to the acquisition of knowledge, discipline, and experience. The effects of experience on problem solving are not always beneficial. In industry, the need to improve already successful products provides the ultimate test of creative thinking. When using personal analogy, the problem solver identifies personally with some part of the problem or solution, thus acting out the situation. Fantasy analogy allows the designer to suspend the sense of credulity and to explore the seemingly fantastic or impossible. Creativity is not only skill or talent but is also related to context—the situation within which the person perceives the problem and performs the process.",Butterworth-Heinemann,

We take the view that intuition can be modeled as a rational and deductive mode of information processing which is suited to novel, complex situations. In this research, a computational algorithm, or “intuitive reasoner”, is proposed which mimics some aspects of human intuition by combining established mathematical tools, such as fuzzy set theory, and some novel innovations. A rule-based scheme is followed and a rule-learning module that allows rules to be learned from incomplete datasets is developed. The input and the rules drawn by the reasoner are allowed to be fuzzy, multi-valued, and low in certainty. A measure of the certainty level, Strength of Belief, is attached to each input as well as each rule. Solutions are formulated through iterations of consolidating intermediate reasoning results, during which the Strength of Belief of corroborating intermediate results is combined. An experimental implementation of the proposed intuitive reasoner is reported, in which the reasoner was used to solve a classification problem. The results showed that, when given increasingly sparse input data, the rule-learning module generated more rules of lower associated certainty than when presented with more complete data. The intuitive reasoner was able to make use of these low-certainty rules to solve the classification problems with an accuracy that compared favorably to that of traditional methods based on complete datasets.",,"Artificial Intelligence, Intuition, Knowledge acquisition, Limited certainty"

Classically, the cortex is considered as being driven by the senses, a paradigm which corresponds well to experiments in quiescent or deeply anesthetized states. In awake animals, however, the spontaneous activity cannot be considered as ‘background noise’, but is of comparable—or even higher—amplitude than evoked sensory responses. Recent evidence suggests that this internal activity is not only dominant, but also it shares many properties with the responses to natural sensory inputs, suggesting that the spontaneous activity is not independent of the sensory input. Such evidence is reviewed here, with an emphasis on intracellular and computational aspects. Statistical measures, such as the spike-triggered average of synaptic conductances, show that the impact of internal network state on spiking activity is major in awake animals. Thus, cortical activity cannot be considered as being driven by the senses, but sensory inputs rather seem to modulate and modify the internal dynamics of cerebral cortex. This view offers an attractive interpretation not only of dreaming activity (absence of sensory input), but also of several mental disorders.",,

The issue is relevant for Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) containing elements of widely varying nature. It is important to evaluate GUI aesthetically to determine their acceptability to the users. Computational models have been reported in the literature to perform objective assessment of interface aesthetics. However, the existing models only consider geometric features at the highest level, without considering the content inside the geometry. To address this issue, we propose a computational model to evaluate aesthetics of textual contents present on a GUI. The proposed model is based on empirical data collected from user studies. The model is a weighted sum of six features characterizing text: chromatic contrast, luminance contrast, font size, letter spacing, line height and word spacing. A separate validation study demonstrates the feasibility and potential of the model (showing 87% accuracy in model prediction), which is expected to be useful in predicting usability of a web page in a more refined way. Such modeling has its obvious implications in the context of engineering interactive systems. The proposed model along with the user studies are presented in this paper.",,"Aesthetics, web page, text elements, aesthetic score, categorization"

The objective of a METRIC-based decision problem is to systematically determine the location and quantity of spares that either maximizes the operational availability of a system subject to a budget constraint or minimizes its cost subject to an operational availability target. This type of sparing analysis has proven essential when analyzing the sustainment policies of large-scale, complex repairable systems such as those prevalent in the defense and aerospace industries. Additionally, the frequency of these sparing studies has recently increased as the adoption of performance-based logistics (PBL) has increased. PBL represents a class of business strategies that converts the recurring cost associated with maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) into cost avoidance streams. Central to a PBL contract is a requirement to perform a business case analysis (BCA) and central to a BCA is the frequent need to use METRIC-based approaches to evaluate how a supplier and customer will engage in a performance based logistics arrangement where spares decisions are critical. Due to the size and frequency of the problem there exists a need to improve the efficiency of the computationally intensive METRIC-based solutions. We develop and validate a practical algorithm for improving the computational efficiency of a METRIC-based approach. The accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm are analyzed through a numerical study. The algorithm shows a 94% improvement in computational efficiency while maintaining 99.9% accuracy.",,"Inventory, Performance based logistics, Logistics, Supply chain, Optimization, Outcome based contracting"

Here, we ask whether a common factor underpins our diverse decision-making abilities. We obtained 32 decision-making measures from 830 young people and identified a common factor that we call “decision acuity,” which was distinct from IQ and reflected a generic decision-making ability. Decision acuity was decreased in those with aberrant thinking and low general social functioning. Crucially, decision acuity and IQ had dissociable brain signatures, in terms of their associated neural networks of resting-state functional connectivity. Decision acuity was reliably measured, and its relationship with functional connectivity was also stable when measured in the same individuals 18 months later. Thus, our behavioral and brain data identify a new cognitive construct that underpins decision-making ability across multiple domains. This construct may be important for understanding mental health, particularly regarding poor social function and aberrant thought patterns.",,"decision acuity, computational psychiatry, functional connectivity, adolescence, development"

Essential to this transformation is the modeling of the gaseous fuel supply chain, particularly with hydrogen and biomethane, offering crucial insights for decision-makers. This study introduces a life cycle thinking-based multi-objective optimization model for the integrated design of biomethane and hydrogen gaseous fuel supply chain networks. The model determines optimal resource allocation for the production of the two fuels, integrating them into the conventional gas network. Moreover, it allocates conventional natural gas, biomethane, and hydrogen optimally across building, industry, and transport sectors, considering the life cycle environmental and economic performance of fuel integration paths. Objective functions include minimization of life cycle emissions and levelized cost of energy while maximizing revenue from fuel sales. Integrating life cycle assessment and cost analysis tools, the optimization model quantifies emissions and life cycle costs for biomethane and hydrogen paths. Results identify Pareto-optimal fuel production paths and portfolios, revealing that integrating the alternative fuels into the current gas grid can significantly reduce emissions (up to 250 tonCO2eq/year) and generate substantial carbon tax savings (up to $16,250/year).

In some cases, these expectations could be disappointed, since the proposal is still based on the traditional main pillars of the last generation of data protection laws. In the field of consumer data protection, these pillars are the purpose specification principle, the use limitation principle and the “notice and consent” model. Nevertheless, the complexity of data processing, the power of modern analytics and the “transformative” use of personal information drastically limit the awareness of consumers, their capability to evaluate the various consequences of their choices and to give a free and informed consent. To respond to the above, it is necessary to clarify the rationale of the “notice and consent” paradigm, looking back to its origins and assessing its effectiveness in a world of predictive analytics. From this perspective, the paper considers the historical evolution of data protection and how the fundamental issues coming from the technological and socio-economic contexts have been addressed by regulations. On the basis of this analysis, the author suggests a revision of the “notice and consent” model focused on the opt-in and proposes the adoption of a different approach when, such as in Big Data collection, the data subject cannot be totally aware of the tools of analysis and their potential output. For this reason, the author sustains the provision of a subset of rules for Big Data analytics, which is based on a multiple impact assessment of data processing, on a deeper level of control by data protection authorities, and on the different opt-out model.",,"Data protection, Consent, Data protection impact assessment, Big Data, Data protection authorities"

Design/methodology/approach A LS team with three MTEs conducted three iterations of LS on teaching the Pythagorean Theorem in an in-person, technology-mediated environment. Many forms of data were collected: Desmos activities, videos of research lessons (RLs), videos of MTE RL debriefings, artifacts of student learning in the Desmos Dashboard, and MTEs' written self-reflection. The authors investigate the teacher educators' learning through LS by analyzing the MTE debriefings of the RLs using Bannister’s (2015) framework for teacher learning in communities of practice. Findings The MTEs learned to enact equitable mathematics instruction using technology through addressing emerging issues related to intellectual authority and use of student thinking. Throughout the LS, the MTEs sought ways of promoting students' mathematical authority and using student thinking through features of the Desmos platform. Research limitations/implications This study focuses on MTEs' learning without examining participating preservice teachers' learning. It demonstrates the benefits of LS for MTEs' professional learning. Practical implications This study showcases how a research-based Desmos activity is used and refined to promote MTE learning how to implement equitable mathematics instruction.

Accurate treatment of microcircuit pathways is especially critical for creating models that correctly predict the outcomes of candidate neurological therapies. Recent models are trying to specify how cortical circuits that enable planning and voluntary actions interact with adaptive subcortical microcircuits in the basal ganglia. The basal ganglia are strongly implicated in reinforcement learning, and in all behavior and cognition over which the frontal lobes exert flexible control. The persisting role of the basal ganglia shows that ancient vertebrate designs for motivated action selection proved adaptable enough to support many “modern” behavioral innovations, including fluent generation of language and speech. This paper summarizes how recent models have incorporated realistic representations of microcircuit features, and have begun to trace their computational implications. Also summarized are recent empirical discoveries that provide guidance regarding how to formulate the rules for synaptic modification that govern learning in cortico-striatal pathways. Such efforts are contributing to an emerging synthesis based on an interlocking set of computational hypotheses regarding cortical interactions with basal ganglia and thalamic nuclei.

The present study explores the relation between question asking complexity and problem-solving tasks involving open- and close-ended thinking and how these abilities generalize and compare to AI. In Study 1, participants (N = 89) completed the alternative questions task (AQT), a close-ended riddles task (Stumpers), and the alternate uses task (AUT), a creativity measure. Our results show AQT question complexity wasn't correlated with stumpers performance, although it correlated with AUT originality (r = .3). In Study 2, participants (N = 100) completed the AQT, AUT, and open-ended creative problem-solving (CPS) task. CPS responses were evaluated for originality and quality. A positive correlation was observed between CPS quality and AQT complexity (r = .29) and originality (r = .34). In study 3, AI agents (N = 100) completed the AQT, AUT, stumpers, and CPS tasks. Like humans, AI's AQT originality and complexity were related with open, but not closed problem-solving. AI questions were also significantly more creative and complex, it solved more stumpers and gave higher quality CPS solutions. Surprisingly, human and AI CPS originality didn't differ.

These severe consequences suggest that (1) humans seldom effectively learn from history, and (2) people lack optimal safety response strategies for tunnel fires. To investigate the root causes of accidental tunnel fires and learn from them, we first surveyed the literature on historical tunnel accidents and described the common timeline of accidental tunnel fires. We employed systems thinking, based on the past research, to depict a causal loop diagram of common accidental tunnel fires. We arrived at the following three findings: (1) the literature review proved that the causes of tunnel fires are far more complex than other types of fires, and the damage they generate is greater; (2) in the context of systems thinking, accidental tunnel fires involve many causal relationships which are both continuous and dynamic, including at least three systems, namely vehicles, tunnel control, and safety response; (3) the mental models “the experience of the operators at the tunnel operation control center is just as vital as the safety response” and “safety is more critical than the traffic volume in the tunnel”, can strengthen safety response systems and ensure safe driving in tunnels. Although the structure of each tunnel and the characteristics of each fire differ and present different causal relationships, this study elucidated lessons from accidental tunnel fires and provided required messages for establishing effective safety measures. The results of this study can be used to establish systems thinking models of tunnel fires and can serve as a reference for policy planning and establishing standard operating procedures for safety responses.",,"Systems thinking, Lessons learned, Accidental tunnel fires, Causal loop diagram"

They are related to the acceptance or rejection of the idea of a physical form of what today would be called information for the generating of the embryo as a necessary pre-requisite for specific development and heredity. As a recent example, I scrutinize the dichotomy of genomic causality versus self-organization in 20th and 21st century theories of the generation of form. On the one hand, the generation of patterns and form, as well as the constant outcome in development, are proposed to be causally related to something that is ""preformed"" in the germ cells, the nucleus of germ cells, or the genome. On the other hand, it is proposed that there is no pre-existing form or information, and development is seen as a process where genuinely new characters emerge from formless matter, either by immaterial ""forces of life,"" or by physical-chemical processes of self-organization. I also argue that these different ways of thinking and the research practices associated with them are not equivalent, and maintain that it is impossible to explain the generation of form and constant outcome of development without the assumption of the transmission of pre-existing information in the form of DNA sequences in the genome. Only in this framework of ""preformed"" information can ""epigenesis"" in the form of physical and chemical processes of self-organization play an important role.",,"Genomic causality, Developmental gene regulatory networks, Physical-chemical selforganization in form generation, Preformation versus epigenesis, Morphogenesis, Stochastic fluctuations, Eric Davidson, Aristotle"

This study presents a new evaluation approach to focus on evaluating the generalization capability at the model level. An empirical study was provided and the results reveal four important findings. First, the decision-making system generated at the model design stage outperforms the system generated at the model validation stage, which shows over-learning at the model level. Secondly, for the decision-making system generated either at the model design stage or at the model validation stage, the investment performance in the training period is much better than that in the testing period, exhibiting over-learning at the system level. Third, employing moving timeframe approach is unable to improve the investment performance at the model validation stage. Fourth, reducing the evolution generation and input variables are unable to avoid the over-learning at the model level. The major contribution of this study is to clarify the issue of over-learning at the model and the system level.

For example, people easily make counterfactual statements when reflecting on dramatic events (‘If only I hadn't drunk alcohol the night of the car accident…’). The way in which people select the events to mutate when requested to undo a scenario outcome seems to be governed by general rules. One is that subjects tend to select exceptional (i.e. unusual or surprising) rather than normal events (Kahneman and Tversky 1982a,b; Kahneman and Miller 1986). Another is that subjects prefer to select the first rather than the subsequent events in a causal chain (Wells, Taylor and Turtle 1987). We hypothesized that events corresponding to controllable actions (i.e. voluntary decisions) by the protagonist of a scenario are more mentally mutable than events which occur in the surrounding background. In experiment 1, we manipulated the order and the controllability of four events in a scenario. Contrary to the causal order effect hypothesis, subjects preferred to change the event corresponding to a coluntary decision of the scenario actor, regardless of its relative position in the scenario. Experiment 2 showed that subjects made this choice regardless of the normal vs. exceptional status of the voluntary action event. Experiment 3 gave evidence that an unconstrained action performed by the focal actor of a story is more mutable than a constrained action performed by the same actor. The implications of these findings for the analysis of accidents involving human errors are discussed.",,

First, little exploration has focused on early elementary school students. In addition, close description of the overall context of coding tasks at this level is rare. Further, there is a need for both teacher and student voices around coding experiences to be heard. Moreover, a task engagement framework has not been used to evaluate the process or outcomes of early elementary coding tasks. Therefore, an exploratory holistic case study design was used to investigate student and teacher processes and outcomes of coding lessons in order to fill gaps in the literature. In this study, forty-six 2nd grade students, two teachers, and four researchers completed two one-week units on basic coding. Multiple descriptive and numeric data sources were employed to describe the process and outcomes of learning coding. Conclusions include: (1) teachers should start learning about coding first with short awareness sessions and then move to their own classrooms with knowledge brokers and other forms of assistance; (2) a focus on content and process, including problem-solving, is effective for coding with young children; (3) there can be a high level of engagement for teachers and students with the use of robots and welldesigned, age-appropriate coding tasks, and; (4) multiple data sources and the inclusion of both teacher and student data are essential in exploring coding in classrooms.",,"Elementary education, Robotics, Coding, Teacher learning, Computational thinking"

We critically discuss how his contribution on the one hand, altered and qualified existent models within language, communication and cognitive science, because dialogism removed language and cognition from their abstract and mental seat in the brain, and embedded them instead in situational contexts and embodied interaction. In that sense, his dialogism successfully replaced monological assumptions about the mind, action and thinking with more contextual and temporally distributed ones. On the other hand, we also question why Linell has not pursued a more rigorous empirical program for studying human cognition, when he did establish a theoretical apparatus for approaching cognition from a dialogical starting point. In going through Linell's arguments over the past five decades we suggest that this absence of an empirical program is due to his humanistic roots which both have sensitised him to appreciating the contingencies and dynamics of human sense making and cognition, and have impeded him from buying into a necessary condition for pursuing a cognitive analysis, even if he conceptually and methodologically accepts a distributed view on cognition. The outcome of this discussion leads to an empirical-based cognitive analysis of a medical interaction. Altogether, the purpose of this article is to show how Linell's conceptual framework can be put to use in ways that make a dialogical cognitive science achievable.",,"Per Linell, Dialogical cognition, Distributed cognition, Cognitive ethnography, Distributed language"

That is, emotions cannot be explained by solely focusing on the environment or by solely focusing on the individual. Rather, they reflect an individual’s subjective assessment of their relation to the environment. Appraisal theories further posit this relationship is characterized by the individual (appraised) in terms of a set of criteria, variously called appraisal variables, checks, or dimensions; for example, Is an event congruent with a person’s goals or concerns?; Who or what caused it?; Was it unexpected?; and What control does the person have over its unfolding? The results of these appraisal checks are in turn mapped to emotion. In this chapter, we do not explore appraisal as a theory of emotion elicitation. Rather, we suggest appraisal theories, specifically the criteria that appraisal theories posit, provide a useful framework for characterizing how situations are perceived by a person and influence their behavior. We go on to suggest that computational models of appraisal can provide a clear specification of how these criteria are assessed. Furthermore, such models can help us explore the dynamics of the person-environment relation, specifically how changes in the environment as well as changes in the person’s perceptions and behavior arise and induce those dynamics.",Academic Press,

Declarative programming techniques, where algorithms are derived from a specification of the desired behavior, offer hope to address this problem, since there is a combinatorial reduction in complexity in programming in terms of specifications instead of algorithms, and arbitrary desired properties can be expressed and enforced in specifications directly. However, limitations on performance have prevented programming with declarative specifications from becoming a mainstream technique for general-purpose programming, because a strategy which is both efficient and fully general to derive algorithms from specifications does not yet exist. To address this bottleneck, I propose information-gain computation, a framework where an adaptive evaluation strategy is used to efficiently perform a search which derives algorithms that provide information about a query via the most efficient routes. Within this framework, opportunities to compress the search space present themselves, which suggest that information-theoretic bounds on the performance of such a system might be articulated and a system might be designed to achieve them. The computation of the information measures that are the basis of this strategy crucially depends on a probabilistic semantics for the relations represented by predicates, which may either already be present in a probabilistic logic language, or may be superimposed on a pure logic language. I describe a prototype implementation of Fifth, a system that implements these techniques, and a preliminary empirical study of adaptive evaluation for a simple test program. In the test, the evaluation strategy adapts successfully to efficiently evaluate a query with pathological features that would prevent its evaluation by standard general-purpose strategies.",,"Declarative programming, Probabilistic logic programming, , Adaptive evaluation strategy, Multi-armed bandits"

Recognizing emotion from Electroencephalogram (EEG) has been globally accepted in many applications such as intelligent thinking, decision-making, social communication, feeling detection, affective computing, etc. Nevertheless, due to having too low amplitude variation related to time on EEG signal, the proper recognition of emotion from this signal has become too challenging. Usually, considerable effort is required to identify the proper feature or feature set for an effective feature-based emotion recognition system. To extenuate the manual human effort of feature extraction, we proposed a deep machine-learning-based model with Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). At first, the one-dimensional EEG data were converted to Pearson's Correlation Coefficient (PCC) featured images of channel correlation of EEG sub-bands. Then the images were fed into the CNN model to recognize emotion. Two protocols were conducted, namely, protocol-1 to identify two levels and protocol-2 to recognize three levels of valence and arousal that demonstrate emotion. We investigated that only the upper triangular portion of the PCC featured images reduced the computational complexity and size of memory without hampering the model accuracy. The maximum accuracy of 78.22% on valence and 74.92% on arousal were obtained using the internationally authorized DEAP dataset.",,"Emotion, Convolutional neural network, Feature extraction, EEG, Pearson's correlation coefficient, Complexity"

To this end, we propose a hesitant fuzzy multi-criteria decision making based computational trust model capable of taking into account the fundamental building blocks corresponding to the concept of trust. The proposed model is capable of considering the contextuality property of trust and the subjective priorities of the trustor regarding the chosen goal. This is due to viewing trust not as a single label or an integrated concept, but as a collection of trustworthiness facets that may form the trust decision in various contexts and toward different goals. The main benefit of the proposed model is the consideration of the hesitancy of recommenders and the trustor in the process of trust decision making which can create a more flexible mapping between the social and computational requirements of trust. This type of formulation also allows for taking into account the vagueness of the provided opinions. In addition to the vagueness of the provided opinions, the model is capable of considering the certainty of recommendations and its effect on the aggregation process of gathered opinions. In the proposed model, the taste of the recommenders and the similarity of opinions are also considered. This will allow the model to assign more weight to recommendations that have a similar taste compared to the trustor. Finally, taking into consideration the attitudes of the trustors toward change of personality that may occur for various entities in the environment is another advantage of the proposed model. A step-by-step illustrative example and the results of several experimental evaluations, which demonstrate the benefits of the proposed model, are also presented in this paper.",,"Trust modeling, Hesitant fuzzy sets (HFS), Comparative linguistic expressions, Vagueness, Uncertainty, Multi-criteria decision making (MCDM)"

The balance between these systems is thought to be arbitrated by the relative precision of their separate predictions of reward. In this paper, we argue that various factors in addiction create hyper-precise reward predictions in the habitual system and hypo-precise reward predictions in the goal-directed system, shifting the balance of behavioural control in favour of habit. Based on this, we offer a theoretical account of the utility of episodic future thinking in addiction, interpreting it as increasing the precision of reward estimates in the goal-directed system, thereby enhancing the control of this system over behaviour.",,"Addiction, Goals, Habits, Free energy, Bayesian statistics, Episodic future thinking"

Here we classify different genetic cardiac diseases using Ca2+ transient data and different machine learning algorithms. Methods By studying calcium cycling of disease-specific iPSC-CMs and by using calcium transients measured from these cells it is possible to classify diseases from each other and also from healthy controls by applying machine learning computation on the basis of peak attributes detected from calcium transient signals.

We assume that category information consists in anticipated patterns of agent–environment interactions that can be elicited through overt or covert (simulated) eye movements, object manipulation, etc. This information is firstly encoded when category information is acquired, and then re-enacted during perceptual categorization. The perceptual categorization consists in a dynamic competition between attractors that encode the sensorimotor patterns typical of each category; action prediction success counts as “evidence” for a given category and contributes to falling into the corresponding attractor. The evidence accumulation process is guided by an active perception loop, and the active exploration of objects (e.g., visual exploration) aims at eliciting expected sensorimotor patterns that count as evidence for the object category. We present a computational model incorporating these elements and describing action prediction, active perception, and attractor dynamics as key elements of perceptual categorizations.

However, there is currently a scarcity of studies in the domain literature that utilize MCDM approaches in this application topic. This paper therefore advances the domain literature in two distinctive ways. Firstly, it analyzes and advances the reuse agenda of wastewater from thermal power plants, recognized as large-scale users of water, thus promoting greater water circularity. Secondly, it provides a methodological advance by integrating the notion of Three-Way Decision (3WD) into the computational structure of MCDM methods by introducing a middle reference point. Such an initiative results in a novel 3WD extension of the Measurement of Alternatives and Ranking according to COmpromise Solution (MARCOS) method. Additionally, this work provides a proof that the MARCOS method utilizes a compromise solution in identifying priority alternatives, along with the integration of a Weighted Aggregated Sum Product ASsessment (WASPAS) metric. An initial hypothetical example illustrates how the proposed approach augments the canonical MARCOS method, particularly in promoting the “thinking in threes” as a more natural information processing approach and the high degree of distinguishability of priorities between decision alternatives. An actual case study in a thermal power plant then demonstrates the contributions of this work. With the best-worst method used to determine the priorities of the decision attributes, the findings reveal that wastewater reuse applications achieving reduced costs for needed infrastructures, operational simplicity, technological compatibility, consumer safety and household savings are preferred by stakeholders. The 3WD-MARCOS approach identifies industrial and commercial use, municipal use, environmental restoration, and household use as the high-priority alternatives, with cooking and drinking as least preferred.

From that description, the Sophotechnic Mediation Scale is proposed as a means to assess the extent of an individual's internalization of the new form of thinking. A preliminary empirical investigation with 132 higher education professors and students found the instrument to be statistically consistent, yielding a unidimensional and Gaussian score that behaves as a developmental trait emerging from the interaction with generative AIs, mediated by age and mastery of previous digital technologies and their cultural elements. It is concluded that the results are suggestive of the validity of the new scale and warrant further research.",,"ChatGPT, Chatbots, Artificial intelligence, Cognitive mediation networks theory, Hyperculture, Sophotechnic"

We show that several successful ongoing collaborations exist in the angiogenesis field and analyse what aspects of their approaches led them to achieve novel and impactful biological insight. We conclude that there are common elements we can learn from for the future, and provide a list of guidelines to building a successful collaborative venture. Specifically, we find that a near symbiosis of computation with experimentation reaps the most impactful results by close cyclical feedback and communication between the two disciplines resulting in continual refinement of models, experimental directions and our understanding.

This paper proposes an innovative Fuzzy Computationally Efficient EGARCH model to forecast the volatility of three stock market indexes. The proposed model represents a joint estimation of the membership function parameters of a TSK-type fuzzy inference system along with the leverage effect, asymmetric shock by leverage effect of EGARCH model in forecasting highly nonlinear and complicated financial time series model more accurately. Further unlike the conventional TSK type fuzzy neural network the proposed model uses a functional link neural network (FLANN) in the consequent part of the fuzzy rules to provide an improved mapping. Moreover, a differential evolution (DE) algorithm is suggested to solve the parameters estimation problem of Fuzzy Computationally Efficient EGARCH model. Being a parallel direct search algorithm, DE has the strength of finding global optimal solutions regardless of the initial values of its few control parameters. Furthermore, the DE based algorithm aims to achieve an optimal solution with a rapid convergence rate. The proposed model has been compared with some GARCH family models and hybrid fuzzy systems and GARCH models based on three performance metrics: MSFE, RMSFE, and MAFE. The results indicate that the proposed method offers significant improvements in volatility forecasting performance in comparison with all other specified models.",,"Volatility prediction, Stock markets, GARCH model variants, Fuzzy logic based hybrids, Fuzzy inference with nonlinear functions, Multistep prediction, Differential evolution, Super predictive ability test"

The resulting analysis informs a kind of design that is aimed at reproducing and supporting the programs of action detected in the use of artifacts, as this use is “abducted” from the physical and material form of the artifacts themselves and from the observation of how content is transformed within and across them. This approach to design, called immanent design, has inspired a platform for the user-driven development and use of electronic documents and forms in cooperative and organizational domains.

In close interplay with experiments, theory and computational modeling are essential for understanding how, precisely, neural circuits generate flexible behaviors and their impairments give rise to psychiatric symptoms. This Perspective highlights recent progress in applying computational neuroscience to the study of mental disorders. We outline basic approaches, including identification of core deficits that cut across disease categories, biologically realistic modeling bridging cellular and synaptic mechanisms with behavior, and model-aided diagnosis. The need for new research strategies in psychiatry is urgent. Computational psychiatry potentially provides powerful tools for elucidating pathophysiology that may inform both diagnosis and treatment.

From this perspective, data and analytics hold great promise and are necessary—but not sufficient—for improving strategic decision-making. Something more is needed to realize this potential. We specify how to fill this gap using an integration framework between technology and decision-makers, which is especially appropriate in complex and/or volatile environments.

The paper describes three commonly used modeling methods in this context, geographic information systems, life-cycle assessment, and discrete-time simulation and presents bibliometric analysis of work using these three study methods. Of the 498 publications identified in searches of the Scopus and Web of Science databases, 17 reported on combinations of methods: 10 on life-cycle assessment and geographic information systems, six on joint use of life-cycle assessment and discrete-time simulation, and one on use of geographic information systems jointly with discrete-time simulation. While no articles dealt directly with simultaneous use of all three methods, several acknowledged the potential of this. The authors discuss numerous challenges identified in the review that arise in combining methods, among them computational load, the increasing number of assumptions, guaranteeing coherence between the models used, and the large quantities of data required. Discussion of issues such as the complexity of reporting and the need for standard procedures and terms becomes more critical as repositories bring together research materials, including entire models, from various sources. Efforts to mitigate many of modeling’s challenges have involved phase-specific modeling and use of such methods as expressions or uncertainty analysis in place of a complex secondary model.

While eVTOL manufacturers and logistics service providers are actively developing prototype eVTOLs and exploring their potentials for moving freight, a system thinking about the suitability and ways to operate an eVTOL-based package delivery system remains scarce. A key aspect of the system thinking is the noise impact of eVTOL operations on surrounding communities. In this study, we provide an operation planning framework that aims to prepare AAM to be both economically efficient and community friendly for package delivery. We first develop a method to quantify the community noise impact of an eVTOL operation, using a “population exposure” measure which is based on the level of sound generated and accounts for both the number of people impacted and duration of the impact. Then, a bi-objective integer programming model is formulated which simultaneously optimizes total shipping cost and community noise impact of eVTOL operations. The optimization takes into consideration operational constraints including maximum distance for local delivery, latest package departure time from the warehouse, and eVTOL fleet size and carrying capacity. A tailored solution algorithm which augments non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm 2 (NSGA2) with compact solution representation, guided generation of initial population of solutions, and customized local search heuristics is devised. The model and the algorithm are implemented in a case study in the Chicago metro area. Numerical results reveal the trade-off between the minimization of shipping cost and community noise impact. Several operational insights about eVTOL-based package delivery are obtained. The computational efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed solution algorithm are also demonstrated in comparison with alternative solution methods.",,"Advanced air mobility (AAM), eVTOL, Package delivery, Community noise impact, Bi-objective integer programming model, Tailored solution algorithm"

These different levels of analysis have been used to answer different questions (i.e. understanding behavioral vs. neurobiological anomalies) about the nature of the disorder. As such, these computational studies have mostly supported diverging hypotheses of schizophrenia's pathophysiology, resulting in a literature that is not always expanding coherently.

Here we present a review that first synthesizes the literature of computational modelling for schizophrenia and psychotic symptoms into categories supporting the dopamine, glutamate, GABA, dysconnection and Bayesian inference hypotheses respectively.

However, depending on the desired non-determinism, there are different options of interaction between the existing and the additional structure. This article studies one of those options, which is captured algebraically by dioids.

Eco-efficiency links the environmental performance of a product to its economic value. In this context, this study combines Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Life Cycle Costing (LCC) to propose a two-step eco-efficiency methodology assessment for the fish canning industry. An eco-label rating system based on a descriptive weighting of environmental (Global Warming Potential, Acidification Potential, Eutrophication Potential and the ReCiPe Single Score Endpoint) and economic (Value Added) indicators was applied to the canned anchovy. Secondly, LCA-LCC results were coupled to linear programming (LP) tools in order to define a composite eco-efficiency index. This approach enables translation into economic terms of the environmental damage caused when a given alternative is chosen. In particular, different origins for anchovy species (South American vs. Cantabrian) and related waste management alternatives (landfill, incineration and valorization) were evaluated under this cradle to gate approach. Results indicated that substantial differences can be observed depending on the origin of the fish. Anchovies landed in Cantabria show a higher value added score at the expense of larger environmental impacts, mainly due to fuel use intensity. Moreover, its environmental scores are lowered when fish residues are valorized into marketable products, while increasing the value added.

EoS Simulator can estimate two-phase envelopes, isobars, isotherms, and surfaces related to PTVHS properties. MATLAB Grader courses were proposed to test student learning using the software in two different workshops. The evaluation was based on the achievement of tasks related to intended learning outcomes.

These studies show that multisensory (visual–vestibular) neurons can account for near-optimal cue integration during the perception of self-motion. Unlike the nonlinear (superadditive) interactions emphasized in some previous studies, visual–vestibular neurons accomplish near-optimal cue integration through subadditive linear summation of their inputs, consistent with recent computational theories.

To show this, one utilizes a Helly-type result for algebraic varieties.

One of the first semiempirical approaches in quantum chemistry was the p-electron method proposed by Hǖckel (1931) that generates molecular orbitals (MOs) essentially from the connectivity matrix of a molecule and provides valuable qualitative insights into the structure, stability, and spectroscopy of unsaturated molecules. Hoffmann extended this approach to include all valence electrons and applied in many qualitative studies of inorganic and organometallic compounds. These early semiempirical methods had a lasting impact on chemical thinking as they guided the development of qualitative MO theory that is commonly employed for rationalizing chemical phenomena in terms of orbitals interactions. They are normally not used any longer as computational tools. After a survey of the established methods such as MNDO, AM1, and PM3, recent methodological advances are described including the development of improved semiempirical models, new general-purpose and special-purpose parametrizations, and linear scaling approaches.",Elsevier,

However, the causal effect of testosterone upon emotional decision-making, especially in non-social settings, is still unclear. The present study investigated the role of testosterone in counterfactual thinking: regret is an intense negative emotion that arises from comparison of an obtained outcome from a decision against a better, non-obtained (i.e. counterfactual) alternative. Healthy male participants (n = 64) received a single-dose of 150 mg testosterone Androgel in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, between-participants design. At 180 min post-administration, participants performed the counterfactual thinking task. We applied a computational model derived from behavioral economic principles to uncover latent decision-making mechanisms that may be invisible in simple choice analyses. Our data showed that testosterone increased the ability to use anticipated regret to guide choice behavior, while reducing choice based on expected value. On affective ratings, testosterone increased sensitivity to both obtained and counterfactual outcomes. These findings provide evidence that testosterone causally modulates emotional decision-making, and highlight the role of testosterone in affective sensitivity.",,"Testosterone, Reward, Regret, Emotion, Human male, Dual process"

Herein, we quantify the potential for common CPs that will be used to meet nutrient management goals for Lake Erie to simultaneously improve stream biological conditions throughout the western Lake Erie basin (WLEB) watershed. To do so, we linked a high-resolution watershed-hydrology model to predictive biological models in a conservation scenario framework. Our modeling simulations showed that the implementation of CPs on farm acres in critical and moderate need of treatment, representing nearly half of the watershed, would be needed to reduce spring/early summer total phosphorus loads from the WLEB watershed to acceptable levels. This widespread CP implementation also would improve potential stream biological conditions in >11,000km of streams and reduce the percentage of streams where water quality is limiting biological conditions, from 31% to 20%. Despite these improvements, we found that even with additional treatment of acres in low need of CPs, degraded water quality conditions would limit biological conditions in >3200streamkm. Thus, while we expect CPs to play an important role in mitigating eutrophication problems in the Lake Erie ecosystem, additional strategies and emerging technologies appear necessary to fully reduce water quality limitation throughout the watershed.",,"Best management practices, SWAT, Non-point source pollution, Great Lakes, Ecosystem-based management, Index of Biotic Integrity"

How to cater to the keen interest in OS among students across all universities while providing a rich system software engineering experience? Engaging the OS community on campus plays a pivotal role in enhancing undergraduate education. Our institution has implemented a novel approach over the past nine years through the miniOS pilot class initiative. This program allows students enrolled in the OS course to opt into an additional, practical component where they engage in developing the OS kernel using miniOS, our teaching platform. Participants dedicate their spare time to a series of labs aimed at incrementally introducing them to miniOS, collaborate on a project to add a new functional module to miniOS, and ultimately present their work in a formal defense. This hands-on experience supplements the theoretical coursework, with the notable advantage that pilot class participants are exempt from the traditional final exam. Instead, their grade is determined by their contributions to the pilot class, with distinguished projects being integrated into the evolving miniOS kernel—a witness to the collective effort of each class. Since its inception in 2015, the miniOS pilot class has nurtured 182 undergraduates and 22 graduate students, contributing significantly to the OS community engagement on campus.

Most of its innovation arises from qualitative reasoning by a pencil and paper. Innovation on the circuit structure needs quick analytical justification. Circuit-level reduced-scale modeling is a popular reasoning means. Circuit simulation tools can only serve partial justification on a design, while design insight still has to be acquired via manual analysis. A basic question has been in existence for many decades: how can we automate the analog IC design process? Many analog synthesis tools proposed decades ago could not make it to this date in the design practice. In this survey the major reason is attributed to the black-box style of the tool design. Human designer's creativity is shielded away from the tool operation while the formal design knowledge hardcoded in those tools remains at a very primitive level. By analyzing the defects of those existing tools, this survey advocates an open tool development philosophy whose major goal is to support human-machine interaction. On the one side a design automation tool is mainly aimed at providing aid for tasks that require analytical deduction while on the other side designers are expected to exercise their creativity based on the machine-generated results. Such human-machine co-working style is believed to be a more feasible solution to analog IC design automation based on the currently available computation technology. In this survey the art of symbolic computation is promoted to be the enabling technology for computer-aided analytical generation. The symbolic computation technology today can support topological and analytical reasoning that is the most demanding need in the analog IC design practice.

X-ray images are commonly used and an automated and effective method involving deep learning techniques can potentially contribute to quick and accurate diagnosis of lung disorders. However, in the study of medical imaging using deep learning, two obstacles limit interpretability. One is an insufficient and imbalanced number of training samples in most medical datasets. The other is excessive training time. Although training time can be reduced by decreasing the number of pixels in the images, training with low resolution images tends to result in poor performance. This study represents a solution to overcome these impediments by balancing the number of images and reducing overall processing time while preserving accuracy. The dataset used in this research contains an unequal number of images in the different classes. The quantity of data in the classes is balanced by creating synthetic images based on the patterns and characteristics of the original images, using a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN). Unwanted regions are removed from the X-ray images, the brightness and contrast of the images are enhanced, and the abnormalities are highlighted by using different artifact removal, noise reduction, and enhancement techniques. We propose a Modified Compact Convolutional Transformer (MCCT) model using 32 × 32 sized images for the categorization of lung disorders into four classes. An ablation study of eleven cases is employed to adjust several hyper parameters and layer topologies. This reduces training time while preserving accuracy. Six transfer learning models, VGG19, VGG16, ResNet152, ResNet50, ResNet50V2, and MobileNet are applied with the same image size the performance is compared with the proposed MCCT model. Our MCCT model records the greatest test accuracy of 95.37%, requiring a short training time, 10-12 s/epoch, whereas the other models only reach near-moderate performance with accuracies ranging from 43% to 79% and training times of 80-90 s/epoch. The robustness of the model with regards to the number of training samples is validated by training the model multiple times reducing the number of training images gradually from 49621 images to 6204 images. Results suggest that even with a smaller dataset, the performance is sustained. Our proposed approach may contribute to an effective CAD based diagnostic system by addressing the issues of insufficient and imbalanced numbers of medical images, excessive training times and low-resolution images.",,"COVID-19, Chest X-rays, Image Preprocessing, Modified compact convolutional transformer, Deep convolutional GAN, Hyper-parameter Tuning"

We prove that for any set A of natural numbers there exists a two-dimensional kinematic system BA with a single particle P whose observable behaviour decides n∈A for all n∈N. The procedure can operate under (a) Newtonian mechanics or (b) relativistic mechanics. The proofs show how any information (coded by some A) can be embedded in the structure of a simple kinematic system and retrieved by simple observations of its behaviour.

The main novelty is to endow represented spaces of interest with an additional function on names, called a parameter, which measures the complexity of a given name. This parameter generalises the size function which is usually used in second-order complexity theory and therefore also central to the framework of Kawamura and Cook. The complexity of an algorithm is measured in terms of its running time as a second-order function in the parameter, as well as in terms of how much it increases the complexity of a given name, as measured by the parameters on the input and output side. As an application we develop a rigorous computational complexity theory for interval computation. In the framework of Kawamura and Cook the representation of real numbers based on nested interval enclosures does not yield a reasonable complexity theory. In our new framework this representation is polytime equivalent to the usual Cauchy representation based on dyadic rational approximation. By contrast, the representation of continuous real functions based on interval enclosures is strictly smaller in the polytime reducibility lattice than the usual representation, which encodes a modulus of continuity. Furthermore, the function space representation based on interval enclosures is optimal in the sense that it contains the minimal amount of information amongst those representations which render evaluation polytime computable.",,"Second-order complexity, Type two complexity, Interval computation, Computable analysis"

When implemented following the paradigms of classical finite element methods, the computational resources required by the k-method are prohibitive even for moderate degree. In order to address this issue, we propose a matrix-free strategy combined with weighted quadrature, which is an ad-hoc strategy to compute the integrals of the Galerkin system. Matrix-free weighted quadrature (MF-WQ) speeds up matrix operations, and, perhaps even more important, greatly reduces memory consumption. Our strategy also requires an efficient preconditioner for the linear system iterative solver. In this work we deal with an elliptic model problem, and adopt a preconditioner based on the Fast Diagonalization method, an old idea to solve Sylvester-like equations. Our numerical tests show that the isogeometric solver based on MF-WQ is faster than standard approaches (where the main cost is the matrix formation by standard Gaussian quadrature) even for low degree. But the main achievement is that, with MF-WQ, the k-method gets orders of magnitude faster by increasing the degree, given a target accuracy. Therefore, we are able to show the superiority, in terms of computational efficiency, of the high-degree k-method with respect to low-degree isogeometric discretizations. What we present here is applicable to more complex and realistic differential problems, but its effectiveness will depend on the preconditioner stage, which is as always problem-dependent. This situation is typical of modern high-order methods: the overall performance is mainly related to the quality of the preconditioner.",,"Isogeometric analysis, , -method, Matrix-free, Weighted quadrature, Preconditioner"

It is argued these problems are resolved if we think of syntax as grounded exclusively in semantic/conceptual properties. Since this implies that FL is phonology-free, it is argued that FL should not be distinguished from a generative computation describable as ‘the language of thought’ (LOT). The paper explores to what extent this (FL=LOT) thesis is consistent with Chomsky's thinking. Chomsky's recent work can be seen as pointing in that direction but it is not consistent with the double-interface assumption, which he continues to regard as conceptually necessary.

Cell-free systems bypass cell walls and remove genetic regulation to enable direct access to the inner workings of the cell. The unprecedented level of control and freedom of design, relative to in vivo systems, has inspired the rapid development of engineering foundations for cell-free systems in recent years. These efforts have led to programmed circuits, spatially organized pathways, co-activated catalytic ensembles, rational optimization of synthetic multi-enzyme pathways, and linear scalability from the micro-liter to the 100-liter scale. It is now clear that cell-free systems offer a versatile test-bed for understanding why nature's designs work the way they do and also for enabling biosynthetic routes to novel chemicals, sustainable fuels, and new classes of tunable materials. While challenges remain, the emergence of cell-free systems is poised to open the way to novel products that until now have been impractical, if not impossible, to produce by other means.",,"Cell-free biology, protein synthesis, Metabolic engineering, Synthetic biology, Synthetic enzymatic pathways, Biocatalysis"

In such navigated TMS, the E-field models have been based on spherical approximation of the head. Such models omit the effects of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and gyral folding, leading to potentially large errors in the computed E-field. So far, realistic models have been too slow for interactive TMS navigation. We present computational methods that enable real-time solving of the E-field in a realistic five-compartment (5-C) head model that contains isotropic white matter, gray matter, CSF, skull and scalp. Using reciprocity and Geselowitz integral equation, we separate the computations to coil-dependent and -independent parts. For the Geselowitz integrals, we present a fast numerical quadrature. Further, we present a moment-matching approach for optimizing dipole-based coil models. We verified and benchmarked the new methods using simulations with over 100 coil locations. The new quadrature introduced a relative error (RE) of 0.3–0.6%. For a coil model with 42 dipoles, the total RE of the quadrature and coil model was 0.44–0.72%. Taking also other model errors into account, the contribution of the new approximations to the RE was 0.1%. For comparison, the RE due to omitting the separation of white and gray matter was >11%, and the RE due to omitting also the CSF was >23%. After the coil-independent part of the model has been built, E-fields can be computed very quickly: Using a standard PC and basic GPU, our solver computed the full E-field in a 5-C model in 9000 points on the cortex in 27 coil positions per second (cps). When the separation of white and gray matter was omitted, the speed was 43–65 cps. Solving only one component of the E-field tripled the speed. The presented methods enable real-time solving of the TMS-induced E-field in a realistic head model that contains the CSF and gyral folding. The new methodology allows more accurate targeting and precise adjustment of stimulation intensity during experimental or clinical TMS mapping.",,"Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), Navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation, Electric field calculation, Coil model, Volume conductor model"

Academics and consultants increasingly use Leadership 4.0 to describe the new leadership style required for the Fourth Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0). It strategically addresses people’s concerns, which are crucial for the effective integration of Industry 4.0, and plays a significant and crucial role in integrating Industry 4.0 into modern workplaces. The primary purpose of this paper is to explore Leadership 4.0 and its needs. Several quality characteristics associated with Digital Leadership 4.0 are investigated, and two-dimensional style matrix presentations for Leadership 4.0 are briefed. Finally, this study identifies and addresses the role of Leadership 4.0 in upcoming industrial management systems. Because digital technologies now impact the entire business, advancing digital strategies requires strong leadership at all levels. With the increasing prevalence of digital transformation in the business sector and the intensification of the ""battle for talent,"" organizations need to consider a more methodical approach to building a solid leadership pipeline with the capabilities required to lead in the digital era. They may place future leaders in positions that require them to go beyond their current competencies and skills to instruct and motivate them to promptly acquire new digital skills. In a new working setting, effectively managing the dynamic interactions between machines, technology, and people is essential for influential digital leaders.

According to one version of this hypothesis, children’s relatively poor memory may make them more likely to regularize inconsistent input (Hudson Kam and Newport, 2005, Hudson Kam and Newport, 2009). This paper reports the result of an experimental and computational investigation of one aspect of this version of the hypothesis. A series of seven experiments in which adults were placed under a high cognitive load during a language-learning task reveal that in adults, increased load during learning (as opposed to retrieval) does not result in increased regularization. A computational model offers a possible explanation for these results. It demonstrates that, unless memory limitations distort the data in a particular way, regularization should occur only in the presence of both memory limitations and a prior bias for regularization. Taken together, these findings suggest that the difference in regularization between adults and children may not be solely attributable to differences in memory limitations during learning.",,"Regularization, Less is More, Computational modeling, Language acquisition"

This alternative model prompts a reassessment of the definition of episodic memory and its distinction from semantic memory.

Tuning material composition for performance allows for the integration of multifaceted functionality and embedded responsiveness within minimal material means. The relationships of material composition and system performance can be dissected into properties of topology (in count, type and association), forces (as the simulation of contextual pressures), and materiality (material properties and constraints of fabrication). When resourcing information about these aspects of material behavior from biological or technological systems, the physical precedents, as specimens and/or models, serve as the primary, and often sole, exemplar. While this is necessary to initiate the study of material make-up as it relates to specific morphological performance, there is an inherent limit when asking how and to what degree the knowledge resourced from that instance applies when alterations from the norm are generated. This research proposes the possibility for testing variants of a morphological system using physical models as the precedent while incorporating multiple means of computational analysis for extensive exploration. The framework begins with the initial stage of deducing principles, regarding material organization and behavior, through comparative physical and computational study. Subsequently, through methods of abduction, new vocabularies of form and potentials in performance are generated primarily through computational exploration. The framework is shaped by research into the design and materialization of complex pre-stressed form- and bending-active architectures. A novel aspect of this framework is the development of a software environment called springFORM. In this environment, material behavior is simulated using basic spring-based (particle system) methods. The novel contribution of this software is in providing means for both manual and algorithmic manipulations of mesh topologies and material properties during the form-finding process. A series of architectural prototypes, which range in scale, define rules for the relationship between topological-material complexity and the sequencing of particular exploratory methods. The studies define the value of the physical precedent as it engenders further material prototypes, spring-based explorations and simulations with finite element analysis. These rules and methods are further elaborated upon through studying the particularly fascinating structural capacity of banana leaf stalks, a material system which is stiff in bending yet highly flexible in torsion. Of interest is a functional robustness which allows for the negotiation of both self-weight and wind loading for a large and fully integrated leaf structure. Methods of simulation and meta-heuristics are developed to address the continual material and topological differentiation of the banana leaf stalk. Case studies are based upon examination of specimens from the species Musa acuminata and Ensete ventricosum. Mechanical properties and geometric descriptions of isolated moments within the stalk provide the basis for computational comparison. Fundamental properties and behaviors are extracted from the plant specimens, yet a full description is not possible because of the plant’s intricate spatial structure. In this case, the computational means serve to elucidate upon the behavior of the complete system as well as provide avenues for exploring its variants. This paper describes an extensible and calibrated framework which can foster enhanced biomimetic insights by explorations which are based upon but extend well beyond initial biological and/or technological precedents.",,"Material behavior, Spring-based simulation, Computational design, Biomimetic research"

We argue for a principle of “limited computational complexity” governing early universe dynamics as simulated by this supercomputer, which translates to a global measure for regulating the infinities of eternal inflation. The rules for time evolution can be thought of as a search algorithm, whose details should be constrained by a stronger principle of “minimal computational complexity”.

However, there has been little research into the effects of C-BLI on the development of L2 academic literacy. This article reports on a case study of how C-BLI mediated a Chinese doctoral student's development of conceptual knowledge of context and subsequent context-specific performance in academic writing. Drawing on data from writing tutorials and interviews, the learner's drafts and invited comments, and think-aloud protocols, the study revealed that the C-BLI interventions that integrated symbolic and dialogic mediation helped the learner attain and enhance awareness of contextual components. The learner appropriated the concept as a tool for thinking in judging appropriateness of rules of thumb and choices of exclusive discourse features in specific contexts of use, which consequently mediated his planning for writing and resulted in the development of performance. The study demonstrates the potential of C-BLI as a driving force for the development of conceptual knowledge and context-specific performance in the academic literacy of L2 learners. It has pedagogical implications for curriculum design, C-BLI-informed literacy and concept-based materials, and teacher development to stimulate teacher awareness in C-BLI.",,"Concept-based language instruction, , Mediation, Concept appropriation, Writing activity, Academic literacy"

Neuroimaging has provided many insights into the neural connectome that underlies creativity; however, the role of brain structure in individuals’ creativity performance when collaborating with others remains largely unexplored. Therefore, this study collected data from 74 single- and paired-player participants using an interactive creativity task platform, including the alternative use task (AUT) and the Chinese Radical Remote Associates Test (CRRAT). Participants’ AUT and CRRAT scores in the above two modes were collected to analyze the moderating effects of connective efficiency (CE). The results showed that the relationship between originality performance in the single- and paired-player modes was moderated by four theoretical graph measures. Specifically, in the case of a high clustering coefficient, local efficiency, global efficiency, or low characteristic path length, individual originality performance was more predictive of interactive originality. Additionally, the relationship between fluency performance in the above two modes was not moderated by CE, flexibility, or CRRAT performance. This study identified the effects of neural transmission efficiency on the relationship between creativity in the two modes.

Our lab experiment and online study show consistent results on how location context impacts people's reporting decisions. This finding informs the design of a novel location-based nudge mechanism, which is tested in another lab experiment with 84 participants and proved to be effective in changing users’ reporting decisions. Our follow-up interview study further suggests that the influence of people's mobility patterns (e.g., expected walking distance) could explain why the nudge design is effective.

In this study, patient-specific simulations of stent deployment were performed for 2 cases to replicate the complete procedure conducted by interventional cardiologists. Subsequent computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analyses were conducted to quantify hemodynamic quantities linked to restenosis. Patient-specific pre-operative models of coronary bifurcations were reconstructed from CT angiography and optical coherence tomography (OCT). Plaque location and composition were estimated from OCT and assigned to models, and structural simulations were performed in Abaqus. Artery geometries after virtual stent expansion of Xience Prime or Nobori stents created in SolidWorks were compared to post-operative geometry from OCT and CT before being extracted and used for CFD simulations in SimVascular. Inflow boundary conditions based on body surface area, and downstream vascular resistances and capacitances were applied at branches to mimic physiology. Artery geometries obtained after virtual expansion were in good agreement with those reconstructed from patient images. Quantitative comparison of the distance between reconstructed and post-stent geometries revealed a maximum difference in area of 20.4%. Adverse indices of wall shear stress were more pronounced for thicker Nobori stents in both patients. These findings verify structural analyses of stent expansion, introduce a workflow to combine software packages for solid and fluid mechanics analysis, and underscore important stent design features from prior idealized studies.

Based on previous work, we hypothesized that people who assert freedom in a determined (D) or counterfactual-intervener (CI) scenario assert this because they are thinking about freedom from constraint and not about freedom from determination (in D) or from inevitability (in CI). We also hypothesized that people who deny that freedom in D or in CI deny this because they are thinking about freedom from determination or from inevitability, respectively, and not about freedom from constraint. To test our hypotheses, we conducted two main online studies. Study I supported our hypotheses that people who deny freedom in D and CI are thinking about freedom from determinism and from inevitability, respectively, but these participants seemed to think about freedom from constraint when they were later considering modified scenarios where acts were not determined or inevitable. Study II investigated a contrary bypassing hypothesis that those who deny freedom in D denied this because they took determinism to exclude mental causation and hence to exclude freedom from constraint. We found that participants who took determinism to exclude freedom generally did not deny causation by mental states, here represented by desires and decisions. Their responses regarding causation by desires and decisions at most weakly mediated the relation between determinism and freedom or responsibility among this subgroup of our participants. These results speak against the bypassing hypothesis and in favor of our hypothesis that these participants were not thinking about freedom from constraint.",,

Because of the abundance of non-coding RNA (ncRNA) in the cell, different species will promiscuously associate with each other, suggesting collective dynamics similar to artificial neural networks. A simple mechanism is proposed allowing ncRNA to perform computations equivalent to neural network algorithms such as Boltzmann machines and the Hopfield model. The quantities analogous to the neural couplings are the equilibrium constants between different RNA species. The relatively rapid equilibration of RNA binding and unbinding is regulated by a slower process that degrades and creates new RNA. The model requires that the creation rate for each species be an increasing function of the ratio of total to unbound RNA. Similar mechanisms have already been found to exist experimentally for ncRNA regulation. With the overall concentration of RNA regulated, equilibrium constants can be chosen to store many different patterns, or many different input–output relations. The network is also quite insensitive to random mutations in equilibrium constants. Therefore one expects that this kind of mechanism will have a much higher mutation rate than ones typically regarded as being under evolutionary constraint.",,

Neural network-based vocoders have emerged as a promising solution within the AI community, offering high-fidelity audio compression. In this paper, we propose LMCodec2, a causal speech codec designed to operate across a range of bit rates while delivering high-quality audio at extremely low bit rates, specifically tailored for satellite voice transmission.

Our experimental evaluations demonstrate that LMCodec2 produces high-quality decoded audio at 0.76 kbps and 1.15 kbps. Notably, at 0.76 kbps, LMCodec2 achieves a MUSHRA (Multi-Stimulus Test with Hidden Reference and Anchor) score that surpasses Encodec's performance at 1.5 kbps.

Stall cell structures are observed clearly in the URANS solutions between 17° and 19° with a spanwise spacing of about 1.4 to 1.8 chord length, which agrees well with a theoretical prediction based on the slope of the lift curve in this angle-of-attack range.

In that phase, designers concentrate on developing concepts through numerous alternatives. Therefore, they constantly sketch so that they can rapidly visualize their ideas. Recently, the design industry has attempted to streamline the design process by implementing 3D model generation in the early design phase so that ideas may be more thoroughly explored, thus improving concept and final design conformance; however, efficiency issues have arisen. In this study, a 3D computational sketch synthesis framework was developed comprising two major components. First, a robust method was proposed to synthesize design alternatives by interpolating an input sketch with sketches in a database so that unvisited combinations may be explored. Secondly, a novel interactive 3D model reconstruction method was developed to facilitate the shape transition of design elements so that designers can quickly evaluate the potential of a large number of design variations. Finally, an interface for design refinement was developed so that designs may be embodied by sketching over the 3D model. To test the proposed methodology, expert designers were recruited for a validation experiment with two conditions followed up by in-depth interviews. In the first condition, the participants were asked to sketch based on a design brief in their current working manner. In the second condition, they were asked to create designs using the proposed framework. It was tested whether there was a difference in the design outcomes. It was demonstrated that the proposed framework resulted in more satisfactory and higher-quality designs and generated design alternatives faster and in greater quantities. All participants agreed that the framework could be useful in the early design phase and responded that the proposed system provides more design inspiration than traditional design methods. Most importantly, it was demonstrated that the proposed framework could enhance the reevaluation potential of design concepts and assist in making better-informed design decisions.",,"Intelligent design system, Assisted creativity, Sketch-based modeling, Computational design, Virtual reality"

Many methods have engaged in automatic video summarization. Although these methods have performed well, they still suffer from limited training data and sparse reward problems. We propose a Progressive Reinforcement Learning Video Summarization structure (PRLVS) with an unsupervised reward. The reward measures the information and quality the selected frames convey without annotations. Striving to earn higher rewards, our PRLVS adopts a “T”-type human thinking paradigm: choosing some key frames and checking if their adjacent frames are better than them. To simulate this paradigm, we decompose the flat strategy into a hierarchical strategy consisting of a horizontal policy and a vertical policy. These two policies are optimized alternatively, which densifies the reward while reducing the exploration space. Their cooperation also makes the agent capture the context information of the whole video at every step. Extensive experimental results on two benchmark databases (i.e., SumMe, TVSum) show that our PRLVS outperforms the comparisons and approaches the supervised methods, which indicates that it is significant to integrate our unsupervised reward into the progressive reinforcement learning structure to address limited annotation and sparse reward problems.",,"Video summarization, Progressive reinforcement learning, Hierarchical strategy"

This concept of precision has crept into several branches of cognitive science and is a lynchpin of emerging ideas in computational psychiatry — where unusual beliefs or experiences are explained as abnormalities in how the brain estimates precision. But what precisely is precision? In this Primer we explain how precision has found its way into classic and contemporary models of perception, learning, self-awareness, and social interaction.

Prior research has largely focused on the question of how language shapes mathematical thinking. The current study considers the converse question. Specifically, it investigates whether the magnitude representations that are thought to anchor understanding of number are also recruited to understand the meanings of graded words. These are words that come in scales (e.g., Anger) whose members can be ordered by the degree to which they possess the defining property (e.g., calm, annoyed, angry, furious). Experiment 1 uses the comparison paradigm to find evidence that the distance, ratio, and boundary effects that are taken as evidence of the recruitment of magnitude representations extend from numbers to words. Experiment 2 uses a similarity rating paradigm and multi-dimensional scaling to find converging evidence for these effects in graded word understanding. Experiment 3 evaluates an alternative hypothesis – that these effects for graded words simply reflect the statistical structure of the linguistic environment – by using machine learning models of distributional word semantics: LSA, word2vec, GloVe, counterfitted word vectors, BERT, RoBERTa, and GPT-2. These models fail to show the full pattern of effects observed of humans in Experiment 2, suggesting that more is needed than mere statistics. This research paves the way for further investigations of the role of magnitude representations in sentence and text comprehension, and of the question of whether language understanding and number understanding draw on shared or independent magnitude representations. It also informs the role of machine learning models in cognitive psychology research.",,"Magnitude representations, Numerical cognition, Graded words, Distributional word semantics, Multi-dimensional scaling, Machine learning"

I argue that mechanistic models are particularly suited for paleoecological predictions but that iterative uncertainty analyses should guide their development. Using a Bayesian framework I propose preregistration and blinded analysis as tools to strengthen the epistemic value of computational experiments.

The accounts of number are based on Lakoff and Núñez’s cognitively-based grounding metaphors for arithmetic. The approach incorporates elements of analogical inference into a generalised framework of conceptual blending, using some ideas from the work of Goguen. The ideas are worked out using Heuristic-Driven Theory Projection (HDTP, a method based on higher-order anti-unification). HDTP provides generalisations between domains, giving a crucial step in the process of finding commonalities between theories. In addition to generalisations, HDTP can also transfer concepts from one domain to another, allowing the construction of new conceptual blends.

The adoption of LLM technology into medical education and training has varied, and little empirical evidence exists to support its use in clinical teaching environments. Objective The aim of the study is to identify and qualitatively evaluate potential use cases and limitations of LLM technology for real-time ward-based educational contexts. Methods A brief, single-site exploratory evaluation of the publicly available ChatGPT-3.5 (OpenAI) was conducted by implementing the tool into the daily attending rounds of a general internal medicine inpatient service at a large urban academic medical center. ChatGPT was integrated into rounds via both structured and organic use, using the web-based “chatbot” style interface to interact with the LLM through conversational free-text and discrete queries. A qualitative approach using phenomenological inquiry was used to identify key insights related to the use of ChatGPT through analysis of ChatGPT conversation logs and associated shorthand notes from the clinical sessions. Results Identified use cases for ChatGPT integration included addressing medical knowledge gaps through discrete medical knowledge inquiries, building differential diagnoses and engaging dual-process thinking, challenging medical axioms, using cognitive aids to support acute care decision-making, and improving complex care management by facilitating conversations with subspecialties. Potential additional uses included engaging in difficult conversations with patients, exploring ethical challenges and general medical ethics teaching, personal continuing medical education resources, developing ward-based teaching tools, supporting and automating clinical documentation, and supporting productivity and task management. LLM biases, misinformation, ethics, and health equity were identified as areas of concern and potential limitations to clinical and training use. A code of conduct on ethical and appropriate use was also developed to guide team usage on the wards. Conclusions Overall, ChatGPT offers a novel tool to enhance ward-based learning through rapid information querying, second-order content exploration, and engaged team discussion regarding generated responses. More research is needed to fully understand contexts for educational use, particularly regarding the risks and limitations of the tool in clinical settings and its impacts on trainee development.",,"ChatGPT, medical education, large language models, LLMs, clinical decision-making"

Immersive technologies have become increasingly common worldwide, helping educators to improve the quality of dance pedagogy and increase the effectiveness of dance training. The article investigates the ways of using immersive technologies powered by artificial intelligence in dance education. The research explores the theoretical literature on dance education and the use of artificial intelligence in dance education and dance choreography. The scholars examine the impact of innovative technology solutions used in dance pedagogical practice on the development of dance skills in students. The study also discusses the functionality of interactive and multimedia dance teaching systems, including AI-powered virtual mentoring and cognitive simulations of human mind operations. The research analysed the use of virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (MR) in dance education. This research also focuses on mobile applications used for teaching modern dance. The proposed framework for dance education is based on digital technologies, which help to develop dance skills and improve teaching practices. The scholars conclude that the development and improvement of dance skills are possible only if a teacher combines virtual and real environments in everyday practices. The findings can be used by dance teachers, professional dancers, software developers, and researchers who examine the innovative practices and the application of artificial intelligence in dance education. The ecosystem model reframes thinking about approaches to dance education and can serve as the basis for further development of dance courses and dance style teaching modes.",,"Artificial intelligence, Dance education, Dance mobile applications, Educational ecosystem, Immersive technologies, Intelligent action recognition system, Interactive dance training, Virtual, Augmented and mixed reality, Virtual mentoring"

We apply principles of valency and electronegativity to filter chemically implausible compositions, which reduces the inorganic quaternary space to 1010 combinations. We demonstrate that estimates of band gaps and absolute electron energies can be made simply on the basis of the chemical composition and apply this to the search for new semiconducting materials to support the photoelectrochemical splitting of water. We show the applicability to predicting crystal structure by analogy with known compounds, including exploration of the phase space for ternary combinations that form a perovskite lattice. Computer screening reproduces known perovskite materials and predicts the feasibility of thousands more.

However, the heterogeneity and social dynamics of stakeholders, particularly farmers, have received less attention. This study develops an Agent-based Environmental and Economic assessment (AEE) model that integrates agent-based model and life cycle thinking methods to simulate the CRB system. The AEE model was applied in Heilongjiang Province of China, to investigate how stakeholder decisions affect CRB's GHG reduction potential and government subsidies. Scenario analyses explore the effects of grain markets, subsidies, and collection distance on environmental and economic outcomes. The findings indicate that more farmers are willing to adopt crop residues collection than those currently practicing it, primarily due to logistical constraints. Key factors influencing adoption include farming income, age, farm size and crop types. CRB contributed to 70.6 % of overall GHG reductions with only 41.6 % of the subsidy, demonstrating higher mitigation efficiency. In conclusion, the government must address the deficiency in crop residues logistics to promote CRB development. Additionally, agricultural policies play a crucial role in ensuring CRB feedstock availability by guiding crop types selection. The results suggest that AEE model is adequate in simulating both micro and macro dynamics in the context of CRB, highlighting the robustness of integrating agent-based model and life cycle thinking methods to study complex issues.",,"Agent-based model, Crop residue-based bioenergy, Life cycle thinking, Environmental and economic impacts, Farmer decision making"

This idea is older than the rediscovery of Mendel’s laws of inheritance, with the turn-of-the-twentieth-century notion eventually labeled as the ‘Baldwin effect’ as one of the many ways in which the standard neo-Darwinian view can be turned around. A condition for this effect is that environmentally induced variation such as phenotypic plasticity or learning is crucial for the initial establishment of a trait. This gives the additional time for natural selection to act on genetic variation and the adaptive trait can be eventually encoded in the genotype. An influential paper published in the late 1980s claimed the Baldwin effect to happen in computer simulations, and avowed that it was crucial to solve a difficult adaptive task. This generated much excitement among scholars in various disciplines that regard neo-Darwinian accounts to explain the evolutionary emergence of high-order phenotypic traits such as consciousness or language almost hopeless. Here, we use analytical and computational approaches to show that a standard population genetics treatment can easily crack what the scientific community has granted as an unsolvable adaptive problem without learning. Evolutionary psychologists and linguists have invoked the (claimed) Baldwin effect to make wild assertions that should not be taken seriously.

Using the universe of welfare cases in Maryland in October 2005, this article compares and contrasts the demographic and case characteristics of parental and relative caregiver cases, also analyzing differences between cases with and without an adult receiving benefits. Findings indicate that relative caregivers have service needs that differ from those of parents and that recipient relative caregivers are more disadvantaged than child-only cases.",,"Kinship care, Child-only cases, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, Relative caregiver, Child welfare policy"

The study highlights the importance of arguing and promoting this reasoning to develop statistical thinking. It is crucial to recognize how early students can be subject to learning experiences that promote a language of uncertainty, assess the evidence provided by the data, and make generalizations. Findings The results reveal that while the educator demonstrated knowledge and skills relevant to the curriculum and conceptual teaching strategies, the understanding of the content by the students and the integration of the PCK components still present a challenge. Practical implications The lesson study collaborative teaching practices that promote PCK have proven effective for informing the design and implementation of instructional practices supporting the development of early statistical thinking in young children.

Viewed from this perspective, this paper provides a model for managing the risk by buying and selling carbon emission futures by implementing techniques that leverage computational intelligence. Three computational intelligence techniques are proposed to provide accurate and timely forecasts for changes in the price of carbon: a novel hybrid neuro-fuzzy controller that forms a closed-loop feedback mechanism called PATSOS; an artificial neural network (ANN) based system; an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). Results are based on 1074 daily carbon price observations collected to comprise a useful time-series dataset and for evaluation of the proposed techniques. The extra-sample performance of the proposed techniques is calculated. Analysis results are compared with those produced by other models. Comparison studies reveal that PATSOS is the most accurate and promising methodology for predicting the price of carbon.

Consequently, several computational intelligence techniques (CITs) for the prediction of ROP have been explored in the literature. This study explores the predictive capabilities of four commonly used CITs in the prediction of ROP and experimentally compare their predictive performance. The CIT algorithm utilizes predictors which are easily accessible continuous drilling data that have physical but complex relationship with ROP based on hydro-mechanical specific energy ROP model. The four CITs compared are the artificial neural network (ANN), extreme learning machine, support vector Regression and least-square support vector regression (LS-SVR). Two experiments were carried out; the first experiment investigates the comparative performance of the CITs while the second investigates the effect of reduced number of predictors on the performance of the models. The results show that all the CITs perform within acceptable accuracy with testing root mean square error range (RMSE) of 18.27–28.84 and testing correlation coefficient (CC) range of 0.71–0.94. LS-SVR has the best predictive performance in terms of accuracy with RMSE of 18.27 and CC of 0.94 while ANN has the best testing execution time at 0.03 s. Also utilizing the specific energy concept in chosen drilling parameters to be included among the predictors shows improved performance with five drilling parameters showing an improvement of 3%–9% in RMSE for LS-SVR in the two well studied. The utilization of the specific energy concept in the selection of the predictors in this study has demonstrated that the easily accessible drilling parameters have immense value to provide acceptable performance in the development of ROP model with CITs.",,"ROP prediction, Neural network, Least square support vector regression, Specific energy, Drilling efficiency, Extreme learning machine"

This paper focuses on electroencephalography (EEG) neurofeedback in which the neural measures of interest are the brain oscillations. To date, the neural mechanisms that underlie successful neurofeedback training are still unexplained. Such an understanding would benefit researchers, funding agencies, clinicians, regulatory bodies, and insurance firms. Based on recent empirical work, an emerging theory couched firmly within computational neuroscience is proposed that advocates a critical role of the striatum in modulating EEG frequencies. The theory is implemented as a computer simulation of peak alpha upregulation, but in principle any frequency band at one or more electrode sites could be addressed. The simulation successfully learns to increase its peak alpha frequency and demonstrates the influence of threshold setting – the threshold that determines whether positive or negative feedback is provided. Analyses of the model suggest that neurofeedback can be likened to a search process that uses importance sampling to estimate the posterior probability distribution over striatal representational space, with each representation being associated with a distribution of values of the target EEG band. The model provides an important proof of concept to address pertinent methodological questions about how to understand and improve EEG neurofeedback success.",,"neurofeedback, electroencephalography, computational neuroscience, computer model"

This analysis includes comparison of the performances of a number of DFT functionals against the CCSD(T) method for the determination of the best DFT method that is able to accurately model H2-BN and H2-AlN systems. The ɷB97X-D, B3LYP-D2, PBEPBE-D2, BHandH methods produced results close to that of the reference CCSD(T) method. Of all methods studied, ɷB97X-D, showing the best performance, is found to be the most appropriate DFT method for H2-B24N24 and Al24N24 systems including dispersive interactions between hydrogen and the host molecule. The ɷB97X-D calculations result in that H2 molecule make the tightest adsorptive bond with Al atom in Al24N24 having an adsorption energy of −0.116 eV, by forming much more stable complex than the H2-B24N24 one. This indicates that Al24N24 has better exohedral hydrogen storage properties. The calculations also revealed that H2 molecules cannot pass through hexagonal rings of B24N24 instead they chemisorb on the cage atoms by breaking BN bond while they can pass through hexagonal rings of Al24N24 without making any damage in the Al–N bond, leading the fact that the Al–N bond is stronger than the B–N bond. Moreover, endohedral addition of H2 molecules up to three can form thermodynamically stable nH2@Al24N24 complexes while endohedral hydrogen addition to B24N24 destabilizes the complexes. Thus, the Al24N24 nanocage is not only structurally more stable than B24N24 nanocage, but also it can accommodate more hydrogen molecules, so it is better candidate for both endohedrally and exohedrally hydrogen storage compared to B24N24.",,"Boron nitride nanocages, Aluminum nitride nanocages, Hyrdogen storage materials, BN, AlN, The DFT methods"

This new model of food delivery is not just increasing congestion in urban centers though, it is also changing the contours and qualities of those doing delivery—namely through gig economy work. This new system of food consumption and provision is rapidly gaining traction, but assessments around its current and future sustainability tend to hold separate the notions of social, environmental and economic sustainability—with few to date working to understand how these can interact, influence and be in conflict with one another. This paper seeks to work with this broader understanding of sustainability, whilst also foregrounding the perspectives of gig economy couriers who are often marginalized in such assessments of the online food delivery system. We make use of systems thinking and Campbell’s conflict model of sustainability to do this. In assessing the online food delivery in this way, we seek to not only provide a counternarrative to some of these previous assessments, but to also challenge those proposing the use of gig economy couriers as an environmentally sustainable logistics intervention in other areas of last-mile logistics to consider how this might impact the broader sustainability of their system, now and in the future.",,"Gig economy couriers, path dependence, rebounds, sustainability, systems thinking"

Moving towards net-zero emissions and to combat climate change, the Singapore government is aiming to achieve 2-Gigawatt-peak (GWp) of solar electricity target by 2030. Accordingly, the share of solar energy in the national grid is targeted to be between ∼2–6% in 2030 and ∼ 3.5–8% in 2040, and carbon emission savings to be ∼0.5–1.4 and ∼ 0.8–2.1 million tonnes per annum in 2030 and 2040 respectively. Although these ambitious targets align with the government's plans for mitigating emissions, Singapore faces great challenge in terms of land availability to install ground-mounted solar PV panels. In this paper, a system dynamics model is developed to study- to what extent can Singapore achieve the targeted solar electricity goals by 2030 or even beyond based on Green Plan 2030, what policies can be identified to achieve these targets, and how much carbon savings can be achieved through Solar electricity deployment. Accordingly, this paper presents systems thinking and system dynamics (ST&SD) methodology to model the growth of Singapore's solar capacity, carbon emission savings and share of electricity demand met by solar electricity while focusing on key complex factors such as area utilisation, subsidies, PV panel efficiency etc. Results of our model simulations and projections, based on the key data and assumptions, and policy scenarios show that Singapore's solar capacity can be accelerated by the implementation of the proposed policies to reach 2GWp goal towards 2030 or even slightly ahead of this timeline. However, should the government revise its solar capacity targets higher for the years past 2030 i.e. to achieve 8% share of total electricity generation, perhaps by 2040, policies such as an increased area utilisation, subsidies and higher panel efficiency need to be introduced. Our model simulations incorporating and evaluating these policy scenarios yielded the results aligning with the projections mentioned above. The results and insights presented in this paper offer useful recommendations to the researchers and policy makers in the field of solar electricity system in Singapore, and to study further for better policy making.",,"Solar electricity capacity, Singapore's energy mix, Systems thinking, System dynamics modelling, Carbon savings, Singapore Green Plan 2030"

This paper provides a background to the concepts, findings and methods of risk estimation that guided the field through the period of its growth to the beginning of the 21st century. It draws attention to several key facts: (a) thus far, genetic risk estimates have been made indirectly using mutation data collected in mouse radiation studies; (b) important uncertainties and unsolved problems remain, one notable example being that we still do not know the sensitivity of human female germ cells to radiation-induced mutations; and (c) the concept that dominated the field thus far, namely, that radiation exposures to germ cells can result in single gene diseases in the descendants of those exposed has been replaced by the concept that radiation exposure can cause DNA deletions, often involving more than one gene. Genetic risk estimation now encompasses work devoted to studies on DNA deletions induced in human germ cells, their expected frequencies, and phenotypes and associated clinical consequences in the progeny.

Specifically, when academic growth was examined further using Generalized Additive Models (GAMs), a complex picture emerged, such that grade level (i.e., kindergarten v. first grade) and subscale type (e.g., Fluency v. Originality) influenced the significance and nature of the relationship (i.e., linear v. nonlinear).

As Malafouris (2015, p. 361) puts it, “cognition is not a within property; it is an in-between process”. Interactive processes configure extended systems within which each human agent is embedded. Yet much research on higher cognition, such as problem solving, reflects an implicit but deep commitment to methodological individualism that casts the agent as the ontological locus of cognition, and largely dictates the nature of the research enterprise. Thus, tasks to measure capacities and gauge reasoning performance are designed in a manner that reduces or eliminates the possibility of interacting with the problem presentation; if thinking takes place in the head, there is no need or reason to engineer procedures wherein agents can interact with the task's physical constituents. Conversely, a methodological interactivism forces one to acknowledge the participative yet not all-encompassing role of capacities such as working memory and thinking dispositions; it also encourages the granular mapping of the cognitive ecosystem from which new ideas emerge. To adopt an interactivist perspective is thus to focus on the cognitive resources of the extended system inviting a careful description of how these resources are dynamically configured over time and space to promote the development of new ideas in problem solving. In turn, a systemic perspective encourages the development of interventions that promote cognitive performance through the optimisation of systemic rather than individualist cognitive resources.",,

Recent developments in agent research introduce strategies based on opponent learning for contract negotiation. In this paper we design a generic framework for strategical negotiation of service level values under time constraints and exemplify the usage of our framework by extending the Bayesian learning agent to cope with the limited duration of a negotiation session.

In this paper, we formulate Vizing's conjecture as a Positivstellensatz existence question. In particular, we select classes of graphs according to their number of vertices and their domination number and encode the conjecture as an ideal/polynomial pair such that the polynomial is non-negative on the variety associated with the ideal if and only if the conjecture is true for this graph class. Using semidefinite programming we obtain numeric sum-of-squares certificates, which we then manage to transform into symbolic certificates confirming non-negativity of our polynomials. Specifically, we obtain exact low-degree sparse sum-of-squares certificates for particular classes of graphs. The obtained certificates allow generalizations for larger graph classes. Besides computational verification of these more general certificates, we also present theoretical proofs as well as conjectures and questions for further investigations.",,"Vizing's conjecture, Algebraic model, Gröbner basis, Sum-of-squares problems, Semidefinite programming"

This study presents two experiments exploring effects of attention during an isometric plantar-flexion task using surface electromyography (sEMG). Participants' attention was directed either externally (towards the force plate they were pushing against) or internally (towards their own leg, specifically the agonist muscle). Experiment 1 tested the effects of attention on accuracy and efficiency of force produced at three target forces (30, 60, and 100% of the maximum voluntary contraction; MVC). An internal focus of attention reduced the accuracy of force being produced and increased cocontraction of the antagonist muscle. Error on a given trial was positively correlated with the magnitude of cocontraction on that trial. Experiment 2 tested the effects of attention on muscular fatigue at 30, 60 and 100%MVC. An internal focus of attention led to less efficient intermuscular coordination, especially early in the contraction. These results suggest that an internal focus of attention disrupts efficient motor control in force production resulting in increased cocontraction, which potentially explains other neuromechanical findings (e.g. reduced functional variability with an internal focus).",,"Attention, Force production, Motor control, Fatigue"

A conceptual model for design education that emphasizes the acquisition of explicit knowledge of design is proposed. The acquisition of knowledge is achieved through the explication of cognitive structures and strategies of design thinking. The explication process is constructed by exploiting a representational formalism, and a computational medium which supports both the learning process as well as the potential re-use of this knowledge.

In this paper, the possibility of optimizing biological wastewater treatment at the Stora Enso Skoghall mill south of the city of Karlstad in central Sweden, with respect to electricity usage and the addition of nutrients, has been investigated. A computational model of the treatment process was developed, based on process data obtained from the said mill, and nine different scenarios were compared subsequently, with energy use, environmental impacts and operational expenses, as criteria. The most energy-efficient and cost-effective alternative was a combination of measures such as lowering the oxygen level in the MBBR (Moving Bed Bio-Reactor) from 3 mg/l to 2 mg/l and using the Hyperclassic aerator in the aerated lagoon. This arrangement yielded a 48.5 % reduction in operational expenses, and a 60 % decrease in the energy use, vis-à-vis the reference case, without affecting the efficiency of the treatment process. This also uncovered an opportunity to mitigate the annual global warming and eutrophication impacts, by approximately 100 tons CO2-eq. and 140 kg PO43−-eq. respectively. All attempts to optimise the use of resources and decrease the anthropogenic environmental footprint ought to be made to come closer to the targets set by the United Nations' sustainable development goals (SDGs). The authors' conclusion predicated on the results of the modelling and analysis done in this study is that the potential of seemingly small process modifications, such as lowering the oxygen level in the MBBR, and applying a more optimal dosage of nutrient salts, must not be overlooked by wastewater treatment plants in general (and those in pulp and paper mills in particular).",,"Aeration, Biological wastewater treatment, Energy use optimisation, Nutrients, Pulp and paper mills"

Most of the proposals for price computation existing in the literature are concerned with short-term competitive equilibrium (generators should not be willing to change the dispatch assigned to them by the auctioneer), which implies operational-cost recovery for all of the generators accepted in the auction. However, this is in general not enough to choose between the different pricing schemes. We propose to include an additional criterion in order to discriminate among different pricing schemes: prices have to be also signals for generation expansion. Using this condition, we arrive to a single solution to the problem of defining prices, where they are computed as the shadow prices of the balance equations in a linear version of the unit commitment problem. Importantly, not every linearization of the unit commitment is valid; we develop the conditions for this linear model to provide adequate investment signals. Compared to other proposals in the literature, our results provide a strong motivation for the pricing scheme and a simple method for price computation.",,"Electricity auctions, Investment signals, Side payments, Integer decisions, Marginal cost"

ACPETC was experimentally characterized by 1H, 13C NMR, FT-IR, UV–Vis and ESI-MS analysis. The molecular structure, vibrational spectra, MEP, ELF, NLO, NBO, NHO, and FMO analysis of ACPETC (C10H14N2OS) in the ground state were estimated using HF, MP2, DFT/B3LYP using the 6–311++G(d,p) basis set. Computed NMR chemical shifts (1H and 13C), as well as discrete regions in IR active vibrations, are in good concurrence with their experimental counterparts. FT-IR spectra of ACPETC were obtained in the ranges of 4000−450 cm−1. The UV–vis spectrum as well as the effects of solvents has been studied.

Anti-doping efforts have previously predominantly focused on athlete behaviours and sophisticated detection methods, however, doping issues remain. As such, there is merit in exploring an alternative approach. The aim of this study was to apply a systems thinking approach to model the current anti-doping system for four football codes in Australia, using the Systems Theoretic Accident Model and Processes (STAMP). The STAMP control structure was developed and validated by eighteen subject matter experts across a five-phase validation process. Within the developed model, education was identified as a prominent approach anti-doping authorities use to combat doping. Further, the model suggests that a majority of existing controls are reactive, and hence that there is potential to employ leading indicators to proactively prevent doping and that new incident reporting systems could be developed to capture such information. It is our contention that anti-doping research and practice should consider a shift away from the current reactive and reductionist approach of detection and enforcement to a proactive and systemic approach focused on leading indicators.

With S100β protein being a metal binding brain-specific receptor for both extracellular and intracellular functions, a change in conformation due to the above-mentioned factors, can compromise their cellular functions and therefore result in several pathological conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease, Ischemic stroke, as well as Myocardial Infarction. Objective The studies conducted sought to elucidate the effect of these physiological factors on the conformational dynamics of S100β protein using computational modeling approaches. Method Temperature-dependent and protein-cofactor complexes molecular dynamics simulations were conducted by varying the temperature from 100 to 400K using GROMACS 5.0.3. Additionally, the conformational dynamics of the protein was studied by varying the pH at 5.0, 7.4 and 9.0 using Ambertools17. This was done by preparing the protein molecule, solvating and minimizing its energy level as well as heating it to the required temperature, equilibrating and simulating under desired conditions (NVT and NPT ensembles). Results The results show that the protein misfolds as a function of increasing temperature with alpha helical content at 100K and 400K being 57.8% and 43.3%, respectively. However, the binding sites of the protein were not appreciably affected by temperature variations. The protein displayed high conformational instability in acidic medium (pH ~5.0). The binding sites of Ca2+, Mg2+ and Zn2+ were identified and each exhibited different groupings of the secondary structural elements (binding motifs). The secondary structure analysis revealed different conformational changes with the characteristic appearance of two beta hairpins in the presence of Zn2+and Mg2+. Conclusion High temperatures, different cofactors and acidic pH confer conformational changes to the S100β structure and these results may indicate the design of novel drugs against the protein.",,"S100β Protein, Molecular Dynamics, Cofactors, Energy Minimization, Physiological Parameters, Alzheimer's"

We study the algebraic structure of the computations carried out by Petri nets from the viewpoint of algebraic automata theory. Petri nets comprise a formalized graphical modeling language, often used to describe computation occurring within biochemical and genetic regulatory networks, but the semantics may be interpreted in different ways in the realm of automata. Therefore, there are several different ways to turn a Petri net into a state-transition automaton. Here, we systematically investigate different conversion methods and describe cases where they may yield radically different algebraic structures. We focus on the existence of group components of the corresponding transformation semigroups, as these reflect symmetries of the computation occurring within the biological system under study. Results are illustrated by applications to the Petri net modelling of intermediary metabolism. Petri nets with inhibition are shown to be computationally rich, regardless of the particular interpretation method. Along these lines we provide a mathematical argument suggesting a reason for the apparent all-pervasiveness of inhibitory connections in living systems.",,"Algebraic automata theory, Petri nets, Krohn-Rhodes theorem, Algebraic biology"

There are several reports of left-handed persons outnumbering the right-handed ones in creative and eminent samples. Hemisphericity and other important brain structures and processes contributing to creative thinking and behavior have more recently been studied with electroencephalogram (EEG), positron emission topography (PET), cerebral blood flow, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques. Numerous EEG studies suggest that there are particular brain wave patterns and brain structures that are associated with creative problem-solving or at least with specific phases within the problem-solving process. EEGs suggest a complex kind of activity while individuals work on tasks indicative of creative potential.

With various transportation options, including driving, public transport, walking, and cycling, commuters encounter various experiences and challenges in their everyday journeys. Understanding how different modes of commuting affect stress levels is essential for improving public health and informing transportation planning. This study develops advanced machine-learning techniques to explore the connection between commuting methods and stress levels. Methods: This research examines how different commuting modes affect stress levels using machine learning methods. The study analyses data collected from 45 individuals who regularly commute to work, focusing on driving, cycling, and public transport modes. Non-invasive wearable sensors were utilised to gather electroencephalography (EEG), blood pressure (BP), and heart rate (HR) data for five consecutive days for each participant. Additionally, qualitative data was collected using the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) questionnaire to assess participants’ emotional responses before and after their commute. The research focuses on developing a machine learning-based model to predict the commute’s impact and monitor the stress level due to the commute mode. In research, objective and subjective factors shape the research process and outcomes. Understanding the interaction between these factors is essential for conducting thorough and reliable research that produces valid results. Our study utilises datasets incorporating qualitative and quantitative data from questionnaires and human bio-signals. Results: This research developed various machine learning algorithms to detect stress levels based on commuting mode. The results indicate that the Linear Discriminant Analysis technique achieved an accuracy of 88%, while Logistic Regression reached 90.66% accuracy. The Boosted Tree algorithm produced the best performance, with an accuracy of 91.11%. Furthermore, incorporating personalised parameters into the data improved the accuracy of these algorithms in detecting stress levels. Cross-validation was also utilised to mitigate the risk of overfitting, ensuring robust and reliable model performance. Conclusion: The findings reveal that human bio-signals tend to increase following commuting, irrespective of the mode, with driving identified as the most stressful option. Commuters using passive modes of transport experience elevated stress levels compared to those using active modes. This research underscores the importance of understanding the connection between commuting modes and stress, providing key insights into the potential health impacts of daily travel. The development of an intelligent model to predict stress levels based on commuting mode offers valuable contributions to public health and transportation planning, with the goal of enhancing well-being and improving commuters’ quality of life.",,"Stress assessment, Blood pressure, Wearable sensors, Commuting, Intelligent transport system, Machine learning"

The B-SNIP consortium identified and validated more neurobiologically homogeneous psychosis Biotypes using an extensive battery of neurocognitive and psychophysiological laboratory measures. However, typically the first step in any diagnostic evaluation is the clinical interview. In this project, we evaluated if psychosis Biotypes have clinical characteristics that can support their differentiation in addition to obtaining laboratory testing. Clinical interview data from 1907 individuals with a psychosis Biotype were used to create a diagnostic algorithm. The features were 58 ratings from standard clinical scales. Extremely randomized tree algorithms were used to evaluate sensitivity, specificity, and overall classification success. Biotype classification accuracy peaked at 91 % with the use of 57 items on average. A reduced feature set of 28 items, though, also showed 81 % classification accuracy. Using this reduced item set, we found that only 10–11 items achieved a one-vs-all (Biotype-1 or not, Biotype-2 or not, Biotype-3 or not) area under the sensitivity-specificity curve of .78 to .81. The top clinical characteristics for differentiating psychosis Biotypes, in order of importance, were (i) difficulty in abstract thinking, (ii) multiple indicators of social functioning, (iii) conceptual disorganization, (iv) severity of hallucinations, (v) stereotyped thinking, (vi) suspiciousness, (vii) unusual thought content, (viii) lack of spontaneous speech, and (ix) severity of delusions. These features were remarkably different from those that differentiated DSM psychosis diagnoses. This low-burden adaptive algorithm achieved reasonable classification accuracy and will support Biotype-specific etiological and treatment investigations even in under-resourced clinical and research environments.",,

The origin of the theories and paradigms come from the adult literature, which has also undergone considerable progress in theoretical advancements and empirical studies over the last several years. The integration of our understanding from the work conducted in adults with consideration of developmental factors provides a way to advance our understanding of judgment and decision-making in children and youth. To accomplish this, establishing stimulus equivalence will be important given that these paradigms were first designed for adult samples. In addition, taking into account the rapid growth and change in cognitive capacities, that happen in development, are central for understanding performance on these paradigms.

Under the practical hypothesis of single physical failures in the network, the backup paths which protect against different logical failure risks (node, link and shared risk link group (SRLG)) cannot be active at the same time. Thus, sharing bandwidth between such backup paths is crucial to increase the bandwidth availability. In this article, we focus on the optimal on-line distributed computation of the bandwidth-guaranteed backup paths in MPLS networks. As the requests for connection establishment and release arrive dynamically without knowledge of future arrivals, we choose to use the on-line mode to avoid LSP reconfigurations. We also selected a distributed computation to offer scalability and decrease the LSP setup time. Finally, the optimization of bandwidth utilization can be achieved thanks to the flexibility of the path choice offered by MPLS and to the bandwidth sharing. For a good bandwidth sharing, the backup path computation entities (BPCEs) require the knowledge and maintenance of a great quantity of bandwidth information (e.g. non aggregated link information or per path information) which is undesirable in distributed environments. To get around this problem, we propose here a PLR (point of local repair)-based heuristic (PLRH) which aggregates and noticeably decreases the size of the bandwidth information advertised in the network while offering a high bandwidth sharing. PLRH permits an efficient computation of backup paths. It is scalable, easy to be deployed and balances equitably computations on the network nodes. Simulations show that with the transmission of a small quantity of aggregated information per link, the ratio of rejected backup paths is low and close to the optimum.",,"Recovery, Local protection, Backup LSP, Failure risk, SRLG, MPLS, Bandwidth sharing, Path computation, Network"

Here these two types of generative intelligence, artificial in machines and real in the human brain are compared, and it is shown how when whole memories are generated by hippocampal recall in response to an incomplete retrieval cue, what the human brain computes, and how it computes it, are very different from generative AI. Key differences are the use of local associative learning rules in the hippocampal memory system, and of non-local backpropagation of error learning in AI. Indeed, it is argued that the whole operation of the human brain is performed computationally very differently to what is implemented in generative AI. Moreover, it is emphasized that the primate including human hippocampal system includes computations about spatial view and where objects and people are in scenes, whereas in rodents the emphasis is on place cells and path integration by movements between places.

The proper equilibrium between these indissoluble forces is operated with multiscale organization: along the dendro–somatic axis of single neurons and at the network level. Fast synaptic inhibition is assured by a multitude of inhibitory interneurons. During cortical activities, these cells operate a finely tuned division of labor that is epitomized by their detailed connectivity scheme. Recent results combining the use of mouse genetics, cutting-edge optical and neurophysiological approaches have highlighted the role of fast synaptic inhibition in driving cognition-related activity through a canonical cortical circuit, involving several major interneuron subtypes and principal neurons. Here we detail the organization of this cortical blueprint and we highlight the crucial role played by different neuron types in fundamental cortical computations. In addition, we argue that this canonical circuit is prone to many variations on the theme, depending on the resolution of the classification of neuronal types, and the cortical area investigated.

Most of these problems are complicated since various factors and their complicated relationships are involved. Success of this decision making relies on efficient business analytics based on the comprehensive and multi-dimensional data related to the static attributes and dynamic operations of the network. To confront the challenges, this paper proposes to explore a methodology of data-driven decision making for supply chain networks. In this methodology, a data-granularity model of a supply chain network is developed to standardize the data form for decision making. A four-dimensional-flow model of a supply chain network is proposed to satisfy the data requirements for decision making that are defined in the data-granularity model. Agent-based computational experiment is employed to support the generation of a comprehensive operational dataset of a supply chain network and to verify the solutions generated in decision making. Integrating these models, a data-driven decision-making framework for supply chain networks is proposed. In the framework, a new decision-making mode of “problem definition - business analytics - solution verification - parameter adjustment” is proposed. Oriented towards domain knowledge in supply chain networks, two approaches of business analytics—mapping analysis and correlation analysis—are presented. Finally, a case of a five-echelon manufacturing supply chain network is studied with the methodology. The findings indicate that the proposed methodology, models and framework are effective in supporting the data-centric decision making for solving complicated operational problems in supply chain networks and provide the networks’ managers or member enterprises with an effective tool to generate unbiased and efficient decisions for the networks’ performance improvement.",,"Data-driven decision making, Supply chain network, Business analytics, Data-granularity model, Four-dimensional-flow model, Agent-based computational experiment"

As a matter of course, the use of high-performance parallel computation for seismic analysis of high-concrete dams must be enforced. The significance and current situation of parallel computation for hydraulic structures using finite element method are briefly described. However, the more difficult task is to develop a parallel program. The EFPG is a finite element program generator using finite element language developed by Chinese Professor Liang Guoping in 1990. The program generated by FEPG can be automatically transformed to corresponding parallel program through the program PFEPG. The parallel computational program by means of FEPG and PFEPG applied in this stage to dynamic analysis for seismic responses of high concrete arch dam system is outlined. The strategy of FEPG is based on component technique and the technique of automatically generating programs. According to the characteristics of domain decomposition method, a finite element program can generally be decomposed to six modules as preprocess partition, start, bft, solv, E, and U programs, in which the subroutines of E and U component are generated by the system based on the scripts VDE or PDE of the partial differential equation describing the physical fields and the corresponding computational algorithms (NFE), other else components are fixed and provided by the FEPG Library. The structures and modules as well as the working operation of FEPG and PFEPG are briefly introduced. The parallel program developed for seismic response analysis of high arch dam by using the FEPG and PFEPG, including the corresponding treatments of dynamic explicit computation process, dynamic contact problem, artificial transmitting, and spring-viscous boundaries, are examined in slight details. The procedure of seismic analysis of arch dam includes three loading cases accomplished successively as follows:1.In case 1, the dam elements were treated as dead elements with zero degree of freedom for nodes, and only the dead load of the foundation rock is considered in the analysis. At the end of calculation, the initial normal compressive force along the contact planes was modified by adding the calculated contact force. All other states of the foundation were recovered to that before loading.2.In case 2, the dead load of dam and other static actions including water pressure, silt pressure, and temperature applied to the dam as well as the seepage pressure in the foundation are considered.3.In case 3, a three-component seismic input is applied to the base of the artificial transmitting boundaries in form of displacement ground motion, or to the spring-viscous boundaries with free field input including boundary stresses, velocities and displacements. In this loading case, the rate effect for dynamic strength and modulus of elasticity are considered.",Academic Press,"seismic response analysis, high arch dam, high-performance parallel computation, component technique, technique of automatically generating programs, FEPG and PFEPG computation programs"

The complementary tasks of explaining what it means for a system to give rise to experience and what constitutes the content of experience (qualia) in computational terms are particularly challenging, given the multiple realizability of computation. In this paper, we identify a set of conditions that a computational theory must satisfy for it to constitute not just a sufficient but a necessary, and therefore naturalistic and intrinsic, explanation of qualia. We show that a common assumption behind many neurocomputational theories of the mind, according to which mind states can be formalized solely in terms of instantaneous vectors of activities of representational units such as neurons, does not meet the requisite conditions, in part because it relies on inactive units to shape presently experienced qualia and implies a homogeneous representation space, which is devoid of intrinsic structure. We then sketch a naturalistic computational theory of qualia, which posits that experience is realized by dynamical activity-space trajectories (rather than points) and that its richness is measured by the representational capacity of the trajectory space in which it unfolds.",,"Representation, Experience, Qualia, Computation, State space, Trajectory, Dynamics, Brain activation, Concept, Clustering"

A closely related discipline (considered usually a part of PSE) is the Computer Aided Process Engineering (CAPE) which is a complementary field that focuses on developing methods and providing solution through systematic computer aided techniques for problems related to the design, control and operation of chemical systems. Nowadays, the ‘PSE’ term suffers from a branding issue to the point that PSE no longer gets the recognition that it deserves. In chemical engineering education the integrative systems frame for process design, control and operations is virtually absent. Its application potential in process industry lags relative to academic research progress and results. This work aims to provide an informative industrial and academic perspective on PSE (focused on the European region), arguing that the ‘systems thinking’ and ‘systems problem solving’ have to be given priority over just applications of computational problem solving methods. A multi-level view of the PSE field is provided within the academic and industrial context, and enhancements for PSE are suggested at their industrial and academic interfaces to create win-win situations.",,"Process systems engineering, Industry, Education, Research, Interface, Perspectives"

The effectiveness of the proposed method hinges on three novelties: (i) the proposed relaxation is computationally efficient and provides an optimal solution most of the time, (ii) if the relaxation produces an infeasible solution, then this solution yields a tight lower bound for the optimal cost, and (iii) it can be modified easily to obtain a feasible solution, which yields an upper bound. In case of infeasibility, the relaxation approach is implemented at each node of the search tree in a branch-and-bound procedure to efficiently search for an optimal solution.

In this work, we performed data mining of TF–glycogene relationships from the Cistrome Cancer database (DB), which integrates chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq) and RNA-Seq data to constitute regulatory relationships. In total, we observed 22,654 potentially significant TF–glycogene relationships, which include interactions involving 526 unique TFs and 341 glycogenes that span 29 the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cancer types. Here, TF–glycogene interactions appeared in clusters or so-called communities, suggesting that changes in single TF expression during both health and disease may affect multiple carbohydrate structures. Upon applying the Fisher’s exact test along with glycogene pathway classification, we identified TFs that may specifically regulate the biosynthesis of individual glycan types. Integration with Reactome DB knowledge provided an avenue to relate cell-signaling pathways to TFs and cellular glycosylation state.

Attempts to model such relationships often neglect indirect mechanisms by which flow influences fish. For example, growth of salmon juveniles is measurably faster when flows inundate floodplain and promote higher production of invertebrate prey, but out-of-channel flows have not yet been incorporated into models. The QUANTUS model developed here represents indirect linkages between flow and freshwater survival, mediated by temperature and prey availability, for fall Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). Quantiles of spawning time and place were used to define cohorts of salmon in a regulated Central Valley, California river. Survival of these quantile-cohorts was simulated through incubation, juvenile growth, and eventual downstream migration. A genetic algorithm was used to optimize the seasonal timing of pulse flows. Simulated survival was highest for flow regimes that provided a modest, temperature-moderating pulse flow in early summer and, for wetter years, a second, larger pulse of over-bank flow in late winter. For many rivers of the Pacific coast that support fall Chinook salmon, the thermal window of opportunity for spawning and rearing is narrow. Optimized flows made the most of this window by providing access to accelerated juvenile growth and early survival in floodplain habitat, a result that should be verified with field experiments. Timing of optimized pulse flows differed in some respects from the region's natural hydrograph, dominated by spring runoff. This suggests that understanding the mechanisms by which flow influences fishes can be important when shaping flows in the changed context of a regulated river.",,"Reservoir releases, Environmental flows, Natural flow paradigm, Optimization, Quantile model, Pulse flows"

One goal of meditation is to identify the arousal of emotions and thoughts, and remain equanimous with them. Over time, meditation may help dampen the attention-grabbing power of these thoughts both during practice and in daily life, which may consequently help deepen meditation practice.

(2009) to explain consumption of goods that feature a low-order attribute (e.g., taste) and a high-order attribute (e.g., health). One brain system with access to the low-order attribute computes the goal value of consumption while another brain system can modulate this value, at a cost, by transmitting information regarding the high-order attribute. We determine the optimal modulation and consumption strategy as a function of the cost of information transmission and the environment. We show that in healthy environments, modulation is used to signal surprisingly unhealthy goods so as to trigger abstinence when consumption would ordinarily occur. Conversely, in unhealthy environments, modulation is used to signal surprisingly healthy choices so as to trigger consumption when abstinence would ordinarily occur. From an outside perspective, individuals may appear to under-regulate their choices (self-indulgence) but also to over-regulate them (self-restraint). Both modulation and decisions are affected by factors orthogonal to the decision problem. In particular, taxing executive functions results in less modulation and more inefficient behavior.

Several authors have been discussing the urgent need for a reconceptualization of osteopathy and also suggesting integrate biological, psychological and social aspects. Thinking osteopathy as a Therapeutic Rationality, implies recognize its fundamental dimensions: Human Morphology, Vital Dynamics, Medical Doctrine, Diagnostic System and Therapeutic System, all integrated by a philosophical Cosmology, as the original term Medical rationality states, but also embrace a broader perspective allowing an individual and unique process of each person, reflecting the transformation of contemporary medicine to a person approach.

These strategies improve the algorithm's ability to explore the search space, optimize the search process, and escape local optima. MBS will be applied to three different types of MHS algorithms: evolutionary based (LSHADE_SPACMA), physical based (Stochastic Fractal Search, SFS), and biological based (Marine Predators Algorithmnm, MPA) to demonstrate the universality of MBS.

Using systems thinking approach that integrates synthetic, analytical and computational techniques, we explore the transformations governing the chemistry of polyoxovanadates (POVs) constructed of arsenate and vanadate building units. The water-soluble salt of the low nuclearity polyanion [V6As8O26]4− can be effectively used for the synthesis of the larger spherical (i.e. kegginoidal) mixed-valent [V12As8O40]4− precipitate, while the novel [V10As12O40]8− POVs having tubular cyclic structures are another, well soluble product. Surprisingly, in contrast to the common observation that high-nuclearity polyoxometalate (POM) clusters are fragmented to form smaller moieties in solution, the low nuclearity [V6As8O26]4− anion is in situ transformed into the higher nuclearity cluster anions. The obtained products support a conceptually new model that is outlined in this article and that describes a continuous evolution between spherical and cyclic POV assemblies. This new model represents a milestone on the way to rational and designable POV self-assemblies.",,

The results indicate that the general public is more critical of the notion of economic growth than academic researchers. Citizens stress problems of corruption, social inequality, unemployment and poverty, with less variation among the three opinion segments compared to scientists. The latter more strongly emphasize the environmental consequences of economic growth. Concerning associations of scientists with the term “green growth”, we find topics questioning its feasibility to be more likely expressed by Degrowth supporters, while topics stressing the possibility of sustainable economic growth by Green growth supporters.

The further complication to these challenges is the stringent time requirements and high dimensionality, which means that traditional optimization techniques, such as gradient-based methods cannot deal with such kinds of problems well. Recent trends tend to use bio-inspired optimization techniques as a promising alternative, and it is usually combined with traditional methods, especially in the area of image processing.

The question remains as to how this can speed up the design process without losing the requirement elucidation intent for concept phase. This paper presents a novel approach with a software toolset to develop design and analysis approaches to early stage ship design and provide a sketching tool. This was done by enhancing the user interface and experience of the UCL Network Block Approach to achieve a “thinking sketch” in a way that is “quick” and “fluid” enough to promote inventive and creative sketching comparable to hand sketching. The UCL Network Block Approach draws on the UCL Design Building Block (DBB) approach and uses network methods applied to the synthesis of distributed ship service systems (DS3) and Computer Aided Ship Design (CASD) to expand DS3 definition in early stage ship design. The UCL originated inside-out/DBB approach to sketch driven synthesis has been made translatable to both DBB ship descriptions and ensuring early stage naval architectural “balance”. The proposed approach has been used for the first time successfully to not only carry out a rapid sketching exercise for a naval ship design but also enable quick preliminary analysis of a set of DS3 networks.,,

In a spatial agent-based model the agents are situated in a spatial environment and are typically assumed to be able to move in various ways across this environment. Some kinds of social or organizational systems may also be modeled as spatial environments, where agents move from one group or department to another and where communications or mobility among groups may be structured according to implicit or explicit channels or transactions costs. This chapter focuses on the potential usefulness of computational laboratories for spatial agent-based modeling. Speaking broadly, a computational laboratory is any computational framework permitting the exploration of the behaviors of complex systems through systematic and replicable simulation experiments. By that definition, most of the research discussed in this handbook would be considered to be work with computational laboratories. A narrower definition of computational laboratory (or comp lab for short) refers specifically to specialized software tools to support the full range of agent-based modeling and complementary tasks. These tasks include model development, model evaluation through controlled experimentation, and both the descriptive and normative analysis of model outcomes. The objective of this chapter is to explore how comp lab tools and activities facilitate the systematic exploration of spatial agent-based models embodying complex social processes critical for social welfare.

The comRAT uses a knowledge base of language data extracted from the Corpus of Contemporary American English. The results obtained are compared to results obtained in empirical tests with humans. In order to explain why some answers might be preferred over others, frequencies of appearance of the queries and solutions are analyzed.

Roadblocks toward greater effectiveness are the huge complexity of many of the necessary computational tasks but also, at a more practical level, the transmission of “computational knowledge” from one researcher to another, much in the same way as experimentalists can rely on readily available equipment (e.g., lasers, etc.), without having to build each item themselves. The solution to this problem will require a cultural shift––from a “cottage industry” to a “big science” mentality––which can be aided by a different attitude on the part of the funding agencies.

Individual auditory neurons are frequency-tuned and respond to brief, 2–10ms FM sweeps with an average of one spike per sound to register their tuned frequencies, to detect echo arrival, or to register a local null in the echo spectrum. When initiated by the broadcast, these responses comprise a cascade of single spikes distributed across time in neurons tuned to different frequencies that persists for 30–50ms, long after the sound has ended. Their progress mirrors the broadcast's propagation away from the bat and the return of echoes for distances out to 5–8m. Each returning echo evokes a similar pattern of single spikes that coincide with ongoing responses to the broadcast to register the target's distance and shape. The hypothesis advanced here is that this flow of responses over time acts as an internal model of sonar acoustics that the bat executes using neuronal computations distributed across many neurons to accumulate a dynamic image of the bat's surroundings.",,

This paper proposes a three-phase approach for multi-criteria ranking in fuzzy environments, which combines the criterion fuzzy concept and three-way decision thinking. The proposed approach not only analyzes the decision-making characteristics of all alternatives but also facilitates their ranking. During the first phase, a qualitative classification method based on the criterion fuzzy concept and ideal solutions is defined, which divides all alternatives into three independent decision sub-regions. During the second phase, by analyzing the priority relationships among the alternatives within every sub-region, three local ranking rules for alternatives are proposed to determine the ranking of alternatives in each classification region. During the third phase, the semantic relations among three classification regions are considered to give an overall ranking of all alternatives. Finally, combined with two existing quantitative ranking indicators, multiple data sets are employed to verify the feasibility and superiority of the proposed three-phase multi-criteria ranking approach.",,"Three-way decision, Criterion fuzzy concept, Three-phase ranking, Multi-criteria ranking"

Frequentism became the dominant mode of statistical thinking in medical practice during the 20th century. The advent of modern computing has made Bayesian analysis increasingly accessible, enabling growing use of Bayesian methods in a range of disciplines, including medical research. Rather than conceiving of probability as the expected frequency of an event (purported to be measurable and objective), Bayesian thinking conceives of probability as a measure of strength of belief (an explicitly subjective concept). Bayesian analysis combines previous information (represented by a mathematical probability distribution, the prior) with information from the study (the likelihood function) to generate an updated probability distribution (the posterior) representing the information available for clinical decision making. Owing to its fundamentally different conception of probability, Bayesian statistics offers an intuitive, flexible, and informative approach that facilitates the design, analysis, and interpretation of clinical trials. In this Review, we provide a brief account of the philosophical and methodological differences between Bayesian and frequentist approaches and survey the use of Bayesian methods for the design and analysis of clinical research.",,

PISM leverages the collaborative efforts of researchers and community partners to analyze complex health systems, identify key determinants, and develop tailored interventions and strategies that are both adaptive and contextually relevant. The phases of the PISM process include strategize, innovate, operationalize, and assess.

Despite proving valuable as computational-level methods to account for people’s behaviour, their descriptive and explanatory powers remain largely unexplored. In a series of experiments, we used a naturalistic crime investigation scenario to examine how people evaluate queries, as well as outcomes, in probabilistic contexts. We aimed to uncover the psychological strategies that people use, not just to assess whether they deviated from OED principles. In addition, we explored the adaptiveness of the identified strategies across both one-shot and stepwise information search tasks. We found that people do not always evaluate queries strictly in OED terms and use distinct strategies, such as by identifying a leading contender at the outset. Moreover, we identified aspects of zero-sum thinking and risk aversion that interact with people’s information search strategies. Our findings have implications for building a descriptive account of information seeking and evaluation, accounting for factors that currently lie outside the realm of information-theoretic OED measures, such as context and the learner’s own preferences.",,"Information search, OED framework, Utility functions, Inquiry, Question asking, Strategies, Probabilistic reasoning, Bayesian Networks"

Deep learning involves huge amounts of matrix multiplications and other operations which can be massively parallelized and thus sped up on GPUs. A single GPU might have thousands of cores while a CPU usually has no more than 12 cores. GPU's practical applicability is affected by two issues: long training time and limited GPU memory, which is greatly influenced as the neural network size grows. In order to overcome these issues, this chapter presents various technologies in distributed parallel processing which improve the training time and optimize the memory, and hardware engine architectures will be explored for data size reduction. The GPUs generally used for deep learning are limited in memory size compared to CPUs, so even the latest Tesla GPU has only 16 GB of memory. Therefore, GPU memory cannot be increased to that extent easily, so networks must be designed to fit within the available memory. This could be a factor limiting progress, overcoming which would be highly beneficiary to the computational intelligence area.",Academic Press,"Deep learning, Parallelization, Graphics processing unit, Hardware architecture, Memory optimization, Computational intelligence"

Whereas I do agree with the authors on most points, I am less convinced that “existing management theory” will suffice to address the problem of “reset thinking”. In this article, I demonstrate that the economy-bias of existing theories is a gateway for “reset thinking” geared towards an allegedly necessary re-/socialisation of management and organisation. A research agenda on cronyism must therefore be complemented by one on privilege and hierarchy not only as undesirable side-effects of cronyism, but also as desired outcomes of advocacy for specific minorities or missions. As self-identifications with group interests or calls for missions have become popular in management theory, I conclude that this new appetite for privilege might undermine not only the higher ideals of many management theorists, but also the foundations of modern society.",,"The Great Reset, Management theory, Cronyism, Stratification, Conservatism, Restorism"

This paper provides a generalization for each method in a unified manner so that they can be used for some difficult maximum likelihood computation, when, for example, there exist constraints on the parameters. A generalized method does not use directly the Newton-type iteration formulas of these methods, but, instead, uses the corresponding quadratic functions transformed from them. It proceeds by repeatedly approximating the log-likelihood function with the quadratic functions in the neighborhoods of the current iterates and optimizing each quadratic function within the parameter space. It is shown that each quadratic function has a weighted linear regression formulation, which can be conveniently solved. This generalization also extends the applicability of the Fisher scoring method to situations when the expected Fisher information matrices are unavailable in closed form. Fast computation can generally be anticipated, owing to their small rates of convergence and a rapid solution of each linear regression problem.

The emergence of computation as a basic scientific methodology in economics has given access to solutions of fundamental problems that pure analysis, observation, or experimentation could not have achieved. Parallel computation represents the wave of the future. It is considered to be cheaper and faster than serial computing and the only approach to faster computation currently foreseeable.

ABSTRACT Undergraduate genetics courses have historically focused on simple genetic models, rather than taking a more multifactorial approach where students explore how traits are influenced by a combination of genes, the environment, and gene-by-environment interactions. While a focus on simple genetic models can provide straightforward examples to promote student learning, they do not match the current scientific understanding and can result in deterministic thinking among students. In addition, undergraduates are often interested in complex human traits that are influenced by the environment, and national curriculum standards include learning objectives that focus on multifactorial concepts. This research aims to discover to what extent multifactorial genetics is currently being assessed in undergraduate genetics courses. To address this, we analyzed over 1,000 assessment questions from a commonly used undergraduate genetics textbook; published concept assessments; and open-source, peer-reviewed curriculum materials. Our findings show that current genetics assessment questions overwhelmingly emphasize the impact of genes on phenotypes and that the effect of the environment is rarely addressed. These results indicate a need for the inclusion of more multifactorial genetics concepts, and we suggest ways to introduce them into undergraduate courses.",,"assessment, curriculum, environment, genes, genetics, undergraduate"

There are multiple facets by which abstraction is measured that include semantic, visual-spatial and social comprehension. This study examined the prevalence and course of abstract and concrete responses to semantic proverbs and aberrant abstraction (composite score of semantic, visual-spatial, and social comprehension) over 20 years in 352 participants diagnosed with schizophrenia, affective psychosis, and unipolar non-psychotic depression. We utilized linear models, two-way ANOVA and contrasts to compare groups and change over time. Linear models with Generalized Estimation Equation (GEE) to determine association. Our findings show that regardless of diagnosis, semantic proverb interpretation improves over time. Participants with schizophrenia give more concrete responses to proverbs when compared to affective psychosis and unipolar depressed without psychosis. We also show that the underlying structure of concretism encompasses increased conceptual overinclusion at index hospitalization and idiosyncratic associations at follow-up; whereas, abstract thinking overtime encompasses increased visual-spatial abstraction at index and rich associations with increased social comprehension scores at follow-up. Regardless of diagnosis, premorbid functioning, descriptive characteristics, and IQ were not associated with aberrant abstraction. Delusions are highly and positively related to aberrant abstraction scores, while hallucinations are mildly and positively related to this score.

The method is based on the expansion of the flow variables on a Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) basis, calculated from a limited number of snapshots, which are obtained via Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Then, the POD-mode amplitudes are calculated as minimizers of a properly defined overall residual of the equations and boundary conditions. The residual can be calculated using only a limited number of points in the flow field, which can be scattered either all over the whole computational domain or over a smaller projection window. This means that the process is both computationally efficient (reconstructed flow fields require less than 1% of the time needed to compute a full CFD solution) and flexible (the projection window can avoid regions of large localized CFD errors). Also, various definitions of the residual are briefly discussed, along with the number and distribution of snapshots, the number of retained modes, and the effect of CFD errors, to conclude that the method is numerically robust. This is because the results are largely insensitive to the definition of the residual, to CFD errors, and to the CFD method itself, which may contain artificial stabilizing terms. Thus, the method is amenable for practical engineering applications.",,"Reduced order model, Proper Orthogonal Decomposition, Incompressible nonisothermal flow"

Depending on whether the exploration is carried backward or forward, trace exploration techniques allow provenance tracking or impact tracking to be done. The aim of provenance tracking is to show how (parts of) a program output depends on (parts of) its input and to help estimate which input data need to be modified to accomplish a change in the outcome. The aim of impact tracking is to identify the scope and potential consequences of changing the program input. Rewriting Logic (RWL) is a logic of change that supplements (an extension of) the equational logic by adding rewrite rules that are used to describe (nondeterministic) transitions between states. In this paper, we present a rich and highly dynamic, parameterized technique for the forward inspection of RWL computations that allows the nondeterministic execution of a given conditional rewrite theory to be followed up in different ways. With this technique, an analyst can browse, slice, filter, or search the traces as they come to life during the program execution. The navigation of the trace is driven by a user-defined, inspection criterion that specifies the required exploration mode. By selecting different inspection criteria, one can automatically derive a family of practical algorithms such as program steppers and more sophisticated dynamic trace slicers that compute summaries of the computation tree, thereby facilitating the dynamic detection of control and data dependencies across the tree. Our methodology, which is implemented in the Anima graphical tool, allows users to evaluate the effects of a given statement or instruction in isolation, track input change impact, and gain insight into program behavior (or misbehavior).",,"Rewriting logic, Trace exploration, Maude, Conditional rewrite theories"

The membrane industry is currently employing a portfolio of established materials, mostly standard polymers or inorganic materials (not originally developed for membranes), and easily scalable manufacturing processes such as phase inversion, interfacial polymerization and coating. Innovations in membranes and their manufacturing processes must meet the desired intrinsic properties that determine selectivity and flux, for specific applications. However, tunable and stable performance, as well as sustainability over the entire life cycle of membrane products are becoming increasingly important. Membrane manufacturers are progressively required to share the carbon footprint of their membrane modules with their customers. Environmental awareness among the world's population is a growing phenomenon and finds its reflection in product development and manufacturing processes. In membrane technology one can see initial steps in this direction with the replacement of hazardous solvents, the utilization of renewable materials for membrane production and the reuse of membrane modules. Other examples include increasing the stability of organic membrane polymers and lowering the cost of inorganic membranes. In a long-term perspective, many more developments in materials science will be required for making new, advanced membranes. These include “tools” such as self-assembly or micro- and nano-fabrication, and “building blocks”, e.g. tailored block copolymers or 1D, 2D and 3D materials. Such membranes must be fabricated in a simpler manner and be more versatile than existing ones. In this perspective paper, a vision of such LEGO®-like membranes with precisely adjustable properties will be illustrated with, where possible, examples that already demonstrate feasibility. These include the possibility to switch properties using an external stimulus, adapting a membrane's selectivity to a given separation, or providing the ability to assemble, disassemble and reassemble the membrane on a suitable support as scaffold, in situ, in place and on-demand. Overall, it is foreseen that the scope of future membrane applications will become much wider, based on improved existing membrane materials and manufacturing processes, as well as the combination of novel, tailor-made “building blocks” and “tools” for the fabrication of next-generation membranes tuned to specific applications.",,

The mechanisms have yet to be fully elucidated and may even be contrary to standard “gate control theory.” Our hypothesis is that a computational model provides a plausible description of the mechanism by which dorsal column stimulation (DCS) inhibits wide dynamic range (WDR) cell output in a neuropathic model but not in a nociceptive pain model. Materials and Methods: We created a computational model of the human spinal cord involving approximately 360,000 individual neurons and dendritic processing of some 60 million synapses—the most elaborate dynamic computational model of the human spinal cord to date. Neuropathic and nociceptive “pain” signals were created by activating topographically isolated regions of excitatory interneurons and high-threshold nociceptive fiber inputs, driving analogous regions of WDR neurons. Dorsal column fiber activity was then added at clinically relevant levels (e.g., Aβ firing rate between 0 and 110 Hz by using a 210-μsec pulse width, 50–150 Hz frequency, at 1–3 V amplitude). Results: Analysis of the nociceptive pain, neuropathic pain, and modulated circuits shows that, in contradiction to gate control theory, 1) nociceptive and neuropathic pain signaling must be distinct, and 2) DCS neuromodulation predominantly affects the neuropathic signal only, inhibiting centrally sensitized pathological neuron groups and ultimately the WDR pain transmission cells. Conclusion: We offer a different set of necessary premises than gate control theory to explain neuropathic pain inhibition and the relative lack of nociceptive pain inhibition by using retrograde DCS. Hypotheses regarding not only the pain relief mechanisms of DCS were made but also regarding the circuitry of pain itself, both nociceptive and neuropathic. These hypotheses and further use of the model may lead to novel stimulation paradigms.",,"Chronic pain, dorsal column stimulation, gate control theory of pain, neural circuitry modeling, neuromodulation mechanism, neuropathic pain, spinal cord stimulation"

The degree of visual imagery present in routine thought and how it is encoded in the brain is largely unknown. We test whether fMRI activity patterns elicited by participants reading objects' names include embodied visual-object representations, and whether we can decode the representations using novel computational image-based semantic models. We first apply the image models in conjunction with text-based semantic models to test predictions of visual-specificity of semantic representations in different brain regions. Representational similarity analysis confirms that fMRI structure within ventral-temporal and lateral-occipital regions correlates most strongly with the image models and conversely text models correlate better with posterior-parietal/lateral-temporal/inferior-frontal regions. We use an unsupervised decoding algorithm that exploits commonalities in representational similarity structure found within both image model and brain data sets to classify embodied visual representations with high accuracy (8/10) and then extend it to exploit model combinations to robustly decode different brain regions in parallel. By capturing latent visual-semantic structure our models provide a route into analyzing neural representations derived from past perceptual experience rather than stimulus-driven brain activity. Our results also verify the benefit of combining multimodal data to model human-like semantic representations.",,"Concept representation, Embodiment, Mental imagery, Perceptual simulation, Language, Multimodal semantic models, Representational similarity"

Computer vision is the field of artificial intelligence that studies how computers can simulate the visual system of humans or other living things. It aims to enable computers to perceive and understand through the processing of visual information based on images or videos. From the 20th century onward, computer vision theory has been progressively developed. King-Sun Fu proposed syntactically structured representation and computation and constructed a top-down computational theory of vision. In the 1970s, David Marr then combined the knowledge of neuroscience, psychology, and other subjects of his time to systematically formulate a computational theory of vision, which made it possible to develop a more rigorous theory of the processing of visual information.

The subsequent emphasis has been placed on effective learning for agricultural managers and their technologist advisors. It is argued that problem solving and learning are essentially the same psychological processes and that taking a systems approach to investigating problem situations provides a more useful paradigm for learning about agriculture than reductionist, discipline-based approaches. Experiential learning and autonomy in learning are seen as consistent with this and are basic features of the programmes. A conceptual framework for problem solving that incorporates soft and hard systems and scientific reductionist methodologies has been developed. A contingency approach to situation improving is emerging as a less restrictive and more realistic alternative to a normative approach to problem solving.",,

The focus of the discussion was Indigenous design for adaptation to climate change in Moananui Oceania with an emphasis on relationships to nature. Given the diversity of Moananui Oceania in terms of languages, cultures, histories, and worldviews, this discussion represented a unique convergence of Indigenous leadership and thought in the field. It highlighted key themes related to Indigenous design for climate change adaptation and offered a novel, distinctive perspective aimed at advancing thinking around nature-based solutions (NbS). It is important to recognise and integrate Indigenous values and approaches to knowledge generation, particularly within academic settings. In the context of Moananui Oceania this can require adapting oral traditions and formats, such as talanoa, and hui or kōrero, into conventional Western-based research formats such as the journal article. This paper is an attempt to capture important Indigenous knowledge and discussion in a western format to enable further dissemination and sharing. This means the format and methodologies described in the paper do not align exactly with traditional scientific journal article formats, however the discussions and findings help to meet the motivation of the authors, which is to transform traditional Indigenous ways of sharing information into a perspective article format and share insights with a wider audience. This methodology aligns well with the special issue call that this paper resides in (Just, Socio-ecological Urban Transformation: Nature-based Solutions and Traditional Ecological Knowledge), underpinning the relevance and potential contribution to the field.

However, with the rapid increase in technology and population, the task of examining the patient becomes cumbersome and sometimes human efforts produce inconsistent results. Several research is being done for healthcare in terms of improving visualization and accuracy by using machine learning models. The current research targets to explore quantum computing as a different way of processing information compared to classical computer systems such as the use of quantum bits (qubits) along with superposition and entanglement for extending the computation capabilities at an unprecedented level of thinking in the healthcare domain. Quantum computing systems provide exponential benefits in terms of high-speed processing, faster and easier diagnostic assistance, unimaginable reduction in processing throughput, and many more. An extensive comparative analysis of existing approaches has been made which benchmarks the need for quantum healthcare computing. The objective of this work is to interpret whether Quantum computers prove to be more trusted when it comes to patient diagnosis, and faster analysis leading to cost optimization. In order to accelerate patient diagnosis, different approaches have been presented. The authors have proposed a precision-based granular approach for patient diagnosis that incorporates diagnosing the disease with enhanced precision and granularity. It involves reporting symptoms by the patient, encountering by healthcare expert on multiple factors, precise examination, granular health status (understanding past and present medical history), followed by a precise intervention by understanding biomolecular simulations. The algorithm has been presented to describe the flow process for patient diagnosis modeling using quantum computing. It involves qubits initialization, pairing the values, assigning probabilistic values, cross-validation, and quantum circuit formation. Precision-based granular approach has been implemented for a scenario (consisting of medical parameters such as oxygen and heart rate level, with the functionality of diagnosing oxygen level and heart range which lies as either normal or not normal (high/low)). Precision-based granular approach deals specifically with the individual ‘biomolecular simulation by understanding variations in the individual body whereas the umbrella-based approach does not deal with specifically to individual mechanisms. Granular level of encounter is not possible in umbrella-based treatment. Python Jupyter notebook and IBM Composer tool is used for the implementation of results. Bloch sphere and computational state graph are obtained as an output for better visualization and understanding. Falcon r5.11H processor is used with the version of 1.0.24 of IBM Composer to simulate the experiment. The methodology using precision based granular approach provides timely encounter of disease along with umbrella diagnosis and precise treatment.

Secondly, in the statistical investigation, the experimental data are analyzed by using linear multiple and quadratic multiple-regression models. Later, in the computational intelligence based investigation, the data obtained from the experimental study are analyzed by using artificial neural networks that are universal approximators which provide a massively parallel processing and decentralized computing. Specially, radial basis function neural network structure is chosen. In this structure, cross-validation technique is used in order to determine the number of radial basis functions.

Also called a cystine-glutamate antiporter, system xc− typically functions by exchanging one molecule of extracellular cystine for one molecule of intracellular glutamate. Nonvesicular glutamate released during cystine-glutamate exchange activates extrasynaptic glutamate receptors in a manner that shapes synaptic activity and plasticity. These findings contribute to the intriguing possibility that extracellular glutamate is regulated by a complex network of release and reuptake mechanisms, many of which are unique to glutamate and rarely depicted in models of excitatory signaling. Because system xc− is often expressed on non-neuronal cells, the study of cystine-glutamate exchange may advance the emerging viewpoint that glia are active contributors to information processing in the brain. It is noteworthy that system xc− is at the interface between excitatory signaling and oxidative stress, because the uptake of cystine that results from cystine-glutamate exchange is critical in maintaining the levels of glutathione, a critical antioxidant. As a result of these dual functions, system xc− has been implicated in a wide array of central nervous system diseases ranging from addiction to neurodegenerative disorders to schizophrenia. In the current review, we briefly discuss the major cellular components that regulate glutamate homeostasis, including glutamate release by system xc−. This is followed by an in-depth discussion of system xc− as it relates to glutamate release, cystine transport, and glutathione synthesis. Finally, the role of system xc− is surveyed across a number of psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders.",,

APER views the affect as the basic form of making sense of reality. It consists of a global, bipolar pattern of neurophysiological activity through which the organism maps the instant-by-instant variation of its environment. Such a pattern of neuropsychological activity is constituted by a plurality of bipolar affective dimensions, each of which maps a component of the environmental variability. The affect has a pluri-componential structure defining a multidimensional affective landscape that foregrounds (i.e., makes pertinent) a certain pattern of facets of the environment (e.g., its pleasantness/unpleasantness) relevant to survival, while backgrounding the others. Doing so, the affect grounds the following cognitive processes. Accordingly, meaning-making can be modeled as a function of the dimensionality of the affective landscape. The greater the dimensionality of the affective landscape, the more differentiated the system of meaning is. Following a brief review of current theories pertaining to the affect, the paper proceeds discussing the APER's core tenets – the multidimensional view of the affect, its semiotic function, and the concepts of Affective Landscape and Phase Space of Meaning. The paper then proceeds deepening the relationship between the APER model and other theories, highlighting how the APER succeeds in framing original conceptualizations of several challenging issues – the intertwinement between affect and sensory modalities, the manner in which the mind constitutes the content of the experience, the determinants of psychopathology, the intertwinement of mind and culture, and the spreading of affective forms of thinking and behaving in society.

Its purpose and objectives define a clear set of expectations for organizations and enterprises, so their network system and supply chain are totally resilient and protected against cyberattacks, man-made threats, and natural disasters. These enterprises include financial, organizational, homeland security, and supply chain operations with multipoint manufacturing across the world. Market share and marketing advantages are expected to result from the implementation of the system. The collected information and defined objectives provide the basis to monitor and analyze the data through cloud computation and will guarantee the success of their survivability against any unexpected threats. Putting this kind of operation in place allows the executive and stakeholders within those organizations and enterprises to make the right decision when encountering threats that interrupt their normal day-to-day operations, as well as, in cases such as defense and homeland security, to predict the next move of an adversary. Given the fact that the BRS, as part of its functionality, processes the incoming data and information if not real time, then near real time with the help of superartificial intelligence in place, this gives the stakeholder an edge against and threats as well as predicting issues with operational intelligence. Artificial intelligence (AI) is one of those technologies that seem to be expanding in every direction. This technology will take center stage at Think 2018. Resilience thinking is inevitably systems thinking, at least as much as sustainable development is. In fact, “when considering systems of humans and nature (social-ecological systems), it is important to consider the system as a whole.” The term “resilience” originated in the 1970s in the field of ecology from the research of C.S. Holling, who defined resilience as “a measure of the persistence of systems and of their ability to absorb change and disturbance and still maintain the same relationships between populations or state variables.” In short, resilience is best defined as “the ability of a system to absorb disturbances and still retain its basic function and structure.” In this chapter, we explain the BRS and how it works.

The ideas of tri-level thinking from three-way decision can shed new light on three-level attribute reduction. Existing classification-specific and class-specific attribute reducts consider only macro-top and meso-middle levels. This paper introduces a micro-bottom level of object-specific reducts. The existing two types of reducts apply to the global classification with all objects and a local class with partial objects, respectively. The new type applies to an individual object. These three types of reducts constitute tri-level attribute reducts. Their development and hierarchy are worthy of systematical explorations. Firstly, object-specific reducts are defined by object consistency from dependency, and they improve both classification-specific and class-specific reducts. Secondly, tri-level reducts are unified by tri-level consistency. Hierarchical relationships between object-specific reducts and class-specific, classification-specific reducts are analyzed, and relevant connections of three-way classifications of attributes are given. Finally, tri-level reducts are systematically analyzed, and two approaches, i.e., the direct calculation and hierarchical transition, are suggested for constructing a specific reduct. We build a framework of tri-level thinking and analysis of attribute reduction to enrich three-way granular computing. Tri-level reducts lead to the sequential development and hierarchical deepening of attribute reduction, and their results profit intelligence processing and system reasoning.",,"Attribute reduction, Three-way decision, Tri-level analysis, Object-specific attribute reducts, Tri-level attribute reducts, Granular computing"

To explore pharmacy students’ perceptions of a novel web application tool (AcaWriter) implemented in a Master of Pharmacy curriculum to support reflective thinking in scientific research. Methods. A qualitative research design involving a 50-minute focus group (n=12) was used. The focus group session was audio-taped, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed thematically using the Braun and Clarke framework. Results. Analysis generated four themes related to AcaWriter’s utility in enhancing students’ research thinking and capacity. The themes identified included: ease of use to prompt reflection, tangible tool with non-judgmental capacity; benefits for enhancing self and peer reflection on research techniques and group dynamics; benefits of the reflective writing process to enhance research capacity compared with engaging in reflective dialogue; and benefits beyond the writing process: cultivating self-improvement and self-confidence. Conclusion. The findings of this study show that a novel web application implemented within a pharmacy curriculum can assist students’ self and peer reflection on a research task.

In this paper we offer a new perspective on optic ataxia; we argue that the popular characterisation of this disorder is misleading and is unrepresentative of the pattern of reaching errors typically observed in OA patients. We begin our paper by reviewing recent neurophysiological, neuropsychological, and functional brain imaging studies that have led to the proposal that the medial parietal cortex in the vicinity of the parietal-occipital junction (POJ) – the key anatomical site associated with OA – represents reaching movements in eye-centred coordinates, and that this ability is impaired in optic ataxia. Our perspective stresses the importance of the POJ and superior parietal regions of the human PPC for representing reaching movements in both extrinsic (eye-centred) and intrinsic (postural) coordinates, and proposes that it is the ability to simultaneously represent multiple spatial locations that must be directly compared with one another that is impaired in non-foveal OA patients. In support of this idea we review recent fMRI and behavioural studies conducted by our group that have investigated the anatomical correlates of posturally guided movements, and the movements guided by postural cues in patients presenting with optic ataxia.",,"Optic ataxia, Neuropsychology of action, Reaching"

Here, in contrast, we examine the perceptual aspect of creativity by asking whether creative individuals are more likely to perceive recognizable forms in ambiguous stimuli –a phenomenon known as pareidolia. To this end, we designed a visual task in which participants were asked to identify as many recognizable forms as possible in cloud-like fractal images. We found that pareidolic perceptions arise more often and more rapidly in highly creative individuals. Furthermore, high-creatives report pareidolia across a broader range of image contrasts and fractal dimensions than do low creatives. These results extend the established body of work on DT by introducing divergent perception as a complementary manifestation of the creative mind, thus clarifying the perception-creation link while opening new paths for studying creative behavior in humans.",,"Cognitive neuroscience, Social sciences, Psychology"

This particularly excludes people who do not conform to these inscribed norms. In the public realm of streets and screens, their bodies now become misidentified as glitches by digitalized welfare services, techno-politics, and passersby. Primarily known as a visual or audible phenomenon of disruption in the technological environment, this paper advocates for conceptualizing the glitch as more than that: it understands the glitch as three-part: 1. a fleeting, but potentially violent error – either by mistake (technical) or by design (social); 2. a moment of refusal of prevailing systems; and 3. as a gateway for changing what it reveals as flawed. Drawing on (auto-)ethnographic fieldwork from 2020 to 2022 on flâneuses* and hackfeminist collectives we will show how these grassroots urbanist actors turn the painful error of their bodies not being considered in techno-urban environments into practices of refusal and change. Creatively and collectively, they manage to turn glitches ‘by design’ into entry points to technologically and socially fight for spaces centering care instead. The portrayed bottom-up practices are important examples for breaking with social and technical binaries: Through strolling and scrolling, they dismantle tools of (digital) domination and provoke to think of who actually participates in ‘smartified’ spaces. Celebrating glitching as refusal, flâneuses* and hackfeminists alike open up questions about the authorship and implemented ideologies hardcoded into the fabric of the cities of today. Moreover, alone and together, their refusal mobilizes alternative, plural futures and makes glitch(ing) a gateway to more caring techno-urban worlds.",,"Glitch, Feminism, Computational cities, Hacking, flâneuse, Care, Refusal"

However, it is particularly challenging to establish an accurate SC unit model under large-scale variable loads and deep peak shaving. To this end, a data-driven modeling strategy combining Transformer-Extra Long (Transformer-XL) and quantum chaotic nutcracker optimization algorithm is proposed. Firstly, three models of the SC unit under once-through/recirculation/shut-down are built via analyzing its mechanism of the operation process, respectively. Secondly, the superior performance of Transformer-XL in obtaining global feature information is employed to effectively solve the problem of high information dependence caused by the strong coupling and nonlinearity of SC unit. Then, the improved quantum chaotic nutcracker optimization algorithm with higher search accuracy is proposed to obtain the optimal parameters of Transformer-XL based on the logistic chaotic mapping and quantum thinking. Feature information dependencies and optimal parameter settings are fully considered in the proposed modeling scheme, which results in an accurate model of SC unit under full operating conditions. Finally, various simulations and comparisons are conducted based on the on-site data of 600 MW SC unit to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed data-driven modeling strategy. According to the improved Transformer-XL, the mean square errors of the proposed SC unit model under once-through/recirculation/shut-down modes are less than 2.500E-03, which verifies the high accuracy of the model. Consequently, the developed model is suitable for application in the controller designing and the operating efficiency and flexibility improvement of SC unit.",,"Supercritical unit, Transformer-XL, Once-through/recirculation/shut-down mode, Quantum chaotic nutcracker optimization algorithm"

The present computations concern: (i) The derivation of the non-parametric equation of the classical caustic about a crack tip through the elimination of the parameter involved (here the polar angle) as well as two geometrical properties of this caustic. (ii) The derivation of the inequalities defining the illuminated region on the screen in the problem of an elastic half-plane loaded normally by a concentrated load with the boundary of this illuminated region related to some extent to the caustic formed. (iii) Similarly for the problem of a clamped circular plate under a uniform loading with respect to the caustic and the pseudocaustic formed.

Proposed computational correlates include architectural specialization (such as the involvement of specific regions of the brain in conscious processing), properties of representations (such as their stability in time or their strength), and properties of specific processes (such as resonance, synchrony, interactivity, or information integration). In exactly the same way as one can engage in a search for the neural correlates of consciousness, one can thus search for the computational correlates of consciousness. The most direct way of doing is to contrast models of conscious versus unconscious information processing. In this paper, I review these developments and illustrate how computational modeling of specific cognitive processes can be useful in exploring and in formulating putative computational principles through which to capture the differences between conscious and unconscious cognition. What can be gained from such approaches to the problem of consciousness is an understanding of the function it plays in information processing and of the mechanisms that subtend it. Here, I suggest that the central function of consciousness is to make it possible for cognitive agents to exert flexible, adaptive control over behavior. From this perspective, consciousness is best characterized as involving (1) a graded continuum defined over quality of representation, such that availability to consciousness and to cognitive control correlates with properties of representation, and (2) the implication of systems of meta-representations.",Elsevier,

Evidence-based models of change are needed to enable shifts in these complex retail environments. Systems thinking offers unique insights by capturing potential unintended consequences and multiple pathways to success. This study sought to create a systems map for retailers, public health practitioners and other stakeholders seeking to implement healthy food retail policies. It aimed to identify (i) points of intervention through which community-based organisations can shift to healthier food provision, and (ii) key feedback loops that could drive potential unintended consequences of such policies in a complex system. Methods Semi-structured interviews (n = 26) were conducted, from 2015 to 2018, across four community food retail settings where healthy food retail policies had been implemented in Victoria, Australia. Interviews were coded by identifying causal relationships and their direction between factors. Vensim software was used to merge interview results and then reduce the map to the strongest and most frequent factors and relationships. Illustrative implementation stories and points of intervention were identified. Findings The resulting map is titled the Systems Thinking Approach for Retail Transformation (START) map. Five prominent implementation stories incorporating 17 factors highlighted that: 1) retailer resistance to change is strongest in the beginning but decreases with the demonstration of favourable initiative outcomes; 2) successive changes tend to be increasingly complex, and therefore harder for retailers to implement; 3) organisational resourcing can be influenced through multiple pathways; 4) customer acceptability of healthy changes and retailers' willingness to engage in changes influence each other; and 5) challenges in accessing healthy supply options make retailers more resistant to implementing healthy changes. Conclusions The application of systems thinking to the challenge of unhealthy food retail creates novel and practical insights for retailers and health promotion practitioners into what actions are most likely to promote healthy changes in complex retail environments.",,"Food retail, Systems mapping, Intervention, Community, Implementation, START map, Nutrition, Policy, Qualitative, Interviews"

However, traditional training methods which provide abstract knowledge have shown ineffective for gaining experience of the work. In order to solve this problem, more and more researchers have included narrative in simulation, which is known as narrative simulation. By providing the narratives, participants recognize the choices, decisions, and experience that lead to the consequences of those decisions. It has been proven that narrative simulation is very useful in facilitating in-depth learning and reflective learning. However, conventional methods of data collection and narrative construction for narrative simulation are labor intensive and time consuming. They make use of previous narratives manually and directly. They are inadequate to cope with the fast moving world where knowledge is changing rapidly. In order to provide a way for facilitating the construction of narrative simulation, a novel computational narrative construction method is proposed. By incorporating technologies of knowledge-based system (KBS), computational linguistics, and artificial intelligence (AI), the proposed method provides an efficient and effective way for collecting narratives and automating the construction of narratives. The method converts the unstructured narratives into a structural representation for abstraction and facilitating computing processing. Moreover, it constructs the narratives that combine multiple narratives into a single narrative by applying a forecasting algorithm. The proposed method was successfully implemented in early intervention in mental health care of a social service company in Hong Kong since the case records in that process have structural similarities to narrative. The accuracies of data conversion and predictive function were measured based on recall and precision and encouraging results were obtained. High recall and precision are achieved in the data conversion function, and high recall for the predictive function when new concepts are excluded. The results show that it is possible for converting multiple narratives into a single narrative automatically. Based on the approach, it helps to stimulate knowledge workers to explore new problem solving methods so as to increase the quality of their solutions.",,"Narrative construction, Knowledge management, Concept mapping, Knowledge-based systems, Computational, Reflective learning, Narrative simulation"

Information systems are treated as dynamic granules used for representing the results of the interaction of attributes with the environment. Two kinds of attributes are distinguished, namely, the perception attributes, including sensory attributes, and the action attributes. Sensory attributes are the basic perception attributes, other perception attributes are constructed on the basis of the sensory ones. Actions are activated when their guards, being often complex and vague concepts, are satisfied to a satisfactory degree. The guards can be approximated on the basis of measurements performed by sensory attributes rather than defined exactly. Satisfiability degrees for guards are results of reasoning called the adaptive judgment. The approximations are induced using hierarchical modeling. We show that information systems can be used for modeling more advanced forms of interactions in hierarchical modeling. The role of hierarchical interactions is emphasized in the modeling of interactive computations. Some illustrative examples of interactions used in the ACT-R 6.0 system are reported. ACT-R 6.0 is based on a cognitive architecture and can be treated as an example of a highly interactive complex granule which can be involved in hierarchical interactions. For modeling of interactive computations, we propose much more general information systems than the studied dynamic information systems (see, e.g., Ciucci (2010) [8] and Pałasiński and Pancerz (2010) [32]). For example, the dynamic information systems are making it possible to consider incremental changes in information systems. However, they do not contain the perception and action attributes necessary for modeling interactive computations, in particular for modeling intrastep interactions.",,"Interactive computing, Interactive systems, Multi-agent systems, Rough sets, Granular computing, Wisdom technology"

In this way, we are able to simulate either automatically or with user interaction, the process of creating works of art of a similar genre and satisfying the properties desired by the artist.

This research contributes to the growing body of knowledge on the intersection of generative AI, education, and multimodal literacy, with a particular emphasis on human-AI collaboration in multicultural settings. It also offers valuable insights for educators seeking to enhance students’ DMC skills through the thoughtful integration of generative AI tools, potentially increasing engagement, motivation, and creative expression among learners from diverse cultural backgrounds.",,"Generative AI, Multimodal composing, Multicultural education"

In this paper we review approaches utilized to build AI tools that facilitate human creativity and allow users to engage fully and authentically in the creative process. These include leveraging AI models to help us shed light on elements of the creative process, building interfaces that encourage exploration of ideas, and designing technological affordances that can support the development of new creative practices.",,"Computational creativity, Generative AI, HCI"

However, common process deviations and post-processing contamination widen the lens of potentially relevant spoilage fungi. For example, although heat-resistant molds are considered the SSOs in thermally processed foods, unintended events (deviations, post-processing contamination) lead to spoilage by other propagules, notably yeast. The frequency of these unintended events changes our assessments of which spoilage fungi are relevant to a given food system. Consequently, a framework using probabilistic and systems-based thinking is needed to understand spoilage risk. Toward that goal, simple molecular tools for identification and subtyping are required.",,

The rate of software piracy appears to be increasing globally, suggesting that additional research that uses new approaches is necessary to evaluate the problem. The study remedies previous econometric and methodological shortcomings by applying Bayesian, robust and evolutionary computation robust regression algorithms to formally test empirical literature on software piracy. To gain further insights into software piracy at the global level, the study also uses five neuro-computational intelligence methodologies: multi-layer perceptron neural network (MLP), probabilistic neural network (PNN), radial basis function neural network (RBF), generalized regression neural network (GRNN) and Kohonen’s self-organizing maps (SOM) to classify, predict and cluster software piracy rates among 102 nations. At the empirical level, this research shows that software piracy is significantly affected by the wealth of nation as measured by gross domestic product (GDP), the nation’s expenditure on research and development and the nation’s judicial efficiency. At the methodological level, this research shows that neuro-computational models outperform traditional statistical techniques such as regression analysis, discriminant analysis and cluster analysis in predicting, classifying and clustering software piracy rates due to their robustness and flexibility of modeling algorithms.",,"Global software piracy, Ethical behavior, Neural networks, Bayesian regression, Evolutionary computation models"

In this study, Chat-GPT, a user-friendly LLM, is used as a problem-solving tool. Chemical engineering education has traditionally focused on fundamental knowledge in the classroom with limited opportunities for hands-on problem-solving. To address this issue, our study proposes an LLMs-assisted problem-solving procedure. This approach promotes critical thinking, enhances problem-solving abilities, and facilitates a deeper understanding of core subjects. Furthermore, incorporating programming into chemical engineering education prepares students with vital Industry 4.0 skills for contemporary industrial practices. During our experimental lecture, we introduced a simple example of building a model to calculate steam turbine cycle efficiency, and assigned projects to students for exploring the possible use of LLMs in solving various aspect of chemical engineering problems. Although it received mixed feedback from students, it was found to be an accessible and practical tool for improving problem-solving efficiency. Analyzing the student projects, we identified five common difficulties and misconceptions and provided helpful suggestions for overcoming them. Our course has limitations regarding using advanced tools and addressing complex problems. We further provide two additional examples to better demonstrate how to integrate LLMs into core courses. We emphasize the importance of universities, professors, and students actively embracing and utilizing LLMs as tools for chemical engineering education. Students must develop critical thinking skills and a thorough understanding of the principles behind LLMs, taking responsibility for their use and creations. This study provides valuable insights for enhancing chemical engineering education's learning experience and outcomes by integrating LLMs.",,"Engineering education, Industry 4.0 skill, Programming in chemical engineering, Problem-solving, Large language models (LLMs), Chat-GPT"

The reason for this development can be found in the special characteristics of Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastics (CFRP) like high stiffness and strength at very low weight which make this composite an ideal material for lightweight design. However, the design of parts made of CFRP is a tightrope walk between costs, mechanical characteristics and manufacturability for product developers. On the one hand, the mechanical properties are highly dependent on the ideal fiber orientation within the part and the unique material characteristics can only be exploited with a suitable fiber orientation, but on the other hand, the ideal fiber orientation is often not manufacturable or the required manufacturing technique is too expensive. Therefore, a novel algorithm to support product developers in finding a manufacturable fiber orientation or patch layout which is as close as possible to the ideal fiber orientation is introduced. This algorithm computes and highlights areas with constant fiber orientation (=cluster) based upon the ideal fiber alignment from the CAIO method. With the help of the visualization of the clusters, product developers can be supported in the decision for the best patch placement and geometry as well as in choosing the best manufacturing technique. It is important to point out that the algorithm is intended for endless fiber reinforced parts only.",,"Lightweight design, Early design stages, Endless fibre reinforced composites"

Factors were identified through a structured review of articles found in the Web of Science. Factor interactions were then characterized through a survey and participatory systems modeling workshop with stakeholders from various fields in the Chilean energy sector. The model emerging from the workshop was structurally analyzed to identify and evaluate system leverage points used to inform recommendations for future policy and practice. A key leverage point identified in this analysis underscores the importance of stakeholder awareness regarding the benefits of renewable energy projects, serving as a crucial catalyst towards decarbonization by fostering citizen support and driving the implementation of favorable public policies. Conversely, the model showed that public opposition to transmission line construction, stemming from health, environmental, and property value concerns, can potentially lead to project delays, increased costs, and challenges in modernizing electrical grids. These findings emphasize the need for public engagement and effective communication to prioritize decarbonization while balancing short-term impacts with long-term benefits.

Sets are represented by closed curves in the plane and often have wellformedness conditions placed on them in order to enhance comprehensibility. The theoretical underpinning for tool support has usually focussed on the problem of generating an Euler diagram from an abstract model. However, the problem of efficient computation of the abstract model from the concrete diagram has not been addressed before, despite this computation being a necessity for computer interpretations of user drawn diagrams. This may be used, together with automated manipulations of the abstract model, for purposes such as semantic information presentation or diagrammatic theorem proving. Furthermore, in interactive settings, the user may update diagrams “on-line” by adding and removing curves, for example, in which case a system requirement is the update of the abstract model (without the necessity of recomputation of the entire abstract model). We define the notion of marked Euler diagrams, together with a method for associating marked points on the diagram with regions in the plane. Utilising these, we provide on-line algorithms which quickly compute the abstract model of a weakly reducible wellformed Euler diagram (constructible as a sequence of additions or removals of curves, keeping a wellformed diagram at each step), and quickly updates both the set of curves in the plane as well as the abstract model according to the on-line operations. Efficiency is demonstrated by comparison with a common, naive algorithm. Furthermore, the methodology enables a straightforward implementation which has subsequently been realised as an application for the user classification domain.",,"Euler diagrams, Region computation, Diagram generation"

We follow the Neuroanatomical differences type of criterion in assessing the results of our study in supporting or not the dual-process theory of Kahneman, 2011) (Systems I & II of thinking). Method We recorded EEGs from 14 scalp electrodes in 30 adults with ADHD, 30 with ASD and 24 healthy, normal subjects. The subjects were exposed in a set of innovative cognitive tasks (inducing varying cognitive loads), the Aristotle's four types of syllogism mentioned above. The multiscale entropy (MSE), a nonlinear information-theoretic measure or tool was computed to extract features that quantify the complexity of the EEG. Results The dynamics of the curves of the grand average of MSE values of the ADHD and ASD participants was significantly in higher levels for the majority of time scales, than the healthy subjects over a number of brain regions (electrodes locations), during the performance of both valid and invalid types of syllogism. This result is seemingly not in accordance of the broadly accepted ‘theory’ of complexity loss in ‘pathological’ subjects, but actually this is not the case as explained in the text. ADHD subjects are engaged in System II of thinking, for both Valid and Invalid syllogism, ASD and Control in System I for valid and invalid syllogism, respectively. A surprising and ‘provocative’ result of this paper, as shown in the next sections, is that the Complexity-variability of ASD and ADHD subjects, when they face Aristotle's types of syllogisms, is higher than that of the control subjects. An explanation is suggested as described in the text. Also, in the case of invalid type of Aristotelian syllogisms, the linguistic and visuo-spatial systems are both engaged ONLY in the temporal and occipital regions of the brain, respectively, of ADHD subjects. In the case of valid type, both above systems are engaged in the temporal and occipital regions of the brain, respectively, of both ASD and ADHD subjects, while in the control subjects only the visuo-spatial type is engaged (Goel et al., 2000; Knauff, 2007). Conclusion Based on the results of the analysis described in this work, the differences in the EEG complexity between the three groups of participants lead to the conclusion that cortical information processing is changed in ASD and ADHD adults, therefore their level of cortical activation may be insufficient to meet the peculiar cognitive demand of Aristotle's reasoning. Significance The present paper suggest that MSE, is a powerful and efficient nonlinear measure in detecting neural dysfunctions in adults with ASD and ADHD characteristics, when they are called on to perform in a very demanding as well as innovative set of cognitive tasks, that can be considered as a new diagnostic ‘benchmark’ in helping detecting more effectively such type of disorders. A linear measure alone, as the typical PSD, is not capable in making such a distinction. The work contributes in shedding light on the neural mechanisms of syllogism/reasoning of Aristotelian type, as well as toward understanding how humans reason logically and why ‘pathological’ subjects deviate from the norms of formal logic.",,"Multiscale entropy, Power Spectral Density, Aristotle's syllogism, ASD-ADHD, Systems of thinking I&II, Cognitive load"

Possible directions for future research are also discussed. Whilst the present modelling studies have achieved great success in unravelling the workings of the retina, they have yet to achieve their full potential.

In the inference task, children were asked to figure out what happened based on whether two speakers agreed or disagreed in their interpretation. In the prediction task, children were provided information about what happened and asked to predict whether two speakers will agree or disagree. Together, these experiments assessed children's understanding that disagreement often results from ambiguity about what happened, and that ambiguity about what happened is often predictive of disagreement. Experiment 1 (N = 52) showed that children are more likely to infer that an ambiguous utterance occurred after learning that people disagreed (versus agreed) about what happened and found that these inferences become stronger with age. Experiment 2 (N = 110) similarly found age-related change in children's inferences and also showed that children could reason in the forward direction, predicting that an ambiguous utterance would lead to disagreement.

In real world situations, however, the available time, motivation, and computational resources may simply not suffice to keep these commandments. Indeed, there is a large body of research suggesting that human choice is often better accommodated by heuristics—simple rules that enable decision making on the basis of a few, but important, pieces of information. We investigated the prevalence of such heuristics in a computerized experiment that engaged participants in a series of choices between two lunch dishes. Employing MouselabWeb, a process-tracing technique, we found that simple heuristics described an overwhelmingly large proportion of choices, whereas strategies traditionally deemed rational were barely apparent in our data. Replicating previous findings, we also observed that visual stimulus segments received a much larger proportion of attention than any nutritional values did.

According to the resulting two-component model of SUD, psychoactive substances interact with genetic and environmental factors to produce delusions about the biological importance of substance use and its contexts by perturbating basic human affective systems. These delusions are most often revised or rejected based on individuals’ existing belief systems. But in some individuals, factors explaining the persistence of an array of delusions (e.g., lower levels of executive functioning) prevent the evaluation and revision system from rejecting or revising beliefs that attribute high salience to substance-related stimuli. This theory provides novel hypotheses regarding the potential roles of factors such as dichotomous thinking, positive illusions and self-deception, and denial or lack of awareness in SUD etiology and recovery.

Polarized light microscopy (PLM) is a tool that I use consistently, in association with other microscopy techniques, to investigate bone in its healthy state and in the presence of bone disease, in humans and in animal models.

Applied to thin bone sections, PLM yields extinct (black) and bright (white) signals that are interpreted in terms of the orientation of collagen type I, by means of other microscopy techniques. Collagen type I is an elementary component of bone tissue. Its orientation is important for the mechanical function of bone. Images obtained by PLM at a specific bone site yield big data sets regarding collagen orientation. Multiple data sets in respect of multiple sites are often needed for research because the bone tissue differs by location in response to the distinct forces acting on it. Mathematics, defined by philosophers as the theory of patterns, offers the backdrop for pattern identification in the big data sets regarding collagen orientation.

The thesis includes a proof that all polynomials are programmable, but that work comes short of giving a complete characterization of the expressive power of the language even for first-order functions. The technical problem is that LRT is non-deterministic. So a natural characterization of its expressive power should be in terms of relations rather than functions. In [Brattka, V., Recursive characterization of computable real-valued functions and relations, Theoretical Computer Science 162 (1) (1996) 45–77], Brattka investigates a formalization of recursive relations in the style of Kleene's recursive functions on the natural numbers. This paper establishes the expressive power of LRTp, a variant of LRT, in terms of Brattka's recursive relations.

However, the lack of quantitative uncertainties associated with contextual, observational information means that much geologic data cannot be statistically treated in computational models using the same approaches as quantitative datasets. This challenge is showcased by the current debate over whether and how geologic data should be used when modeling thermochronologic results, which has important implications for deriving time-temperature (tT) paths from which burial and exhumation histories are interpreted. Holistically leveraging observational data to test hypotheses and determine the set of geologically reasonable thermal histories that can explain thermochronologic results has a longstanding history, but some recent studies have criticized this approach as one that arbitrarily limits tT solutions. Here, a geologic context approach to thermal history modeling, in which observational and thermochronologic datasets are combined to design geologically valid models and reach the most geologically likely interpretation, is illustrated using an example of constraining Great Unconformity exhumation in Colorado where this modeling philosophy has been questioned. Although the quality of geologic data and their applicability to modeled samples can vary and be debated, this does not mean that all geologic data are inherently unreliable and therefore discardable. Exploring models with varying or minimal constraints can be useful to test different hypotheses and determine the resolving power of the data, but using an endmember context-blind approach to interpret thermochronologic results can produce outcomes that violate fundamental aspects of the geology. The strategy outlined here is not the only valid approach to modeling thermochronologic data, but if the purpose of the modeling is to derive meaningful interpretations about sample tT paths in order to better illuminate the geologic history, then critical thinking about the sample context, first order geologic observations, and primary relationships should be integral components of the modeling process.",,"Geologic context approach, (U-Th)/He, Thermal history, Great Unconformity, Pikes Peak, Tava"

Our goal is to unify the main types of deductive reasoning into a single set of basic procedures. In particular, we bring together the microtheories developed from a mental models perspective in a single theory, for which we provide a formal foundation. We validate the theory through a computational model (UNICORE) which allows fine-grained predictions of subjects’ performance in different reasoning domains. The performance of the model is tested against the performance of experimental subjects—as reported in the relevant literature—in the three areas of syllogistic, relational and propositional reasoning. The computational model proves to be a satisfactory artificial subject, reproducing both correct and erroneous performance of the human subjects. Moreover, we introduce a developmental trend in the program, in order to simulate the performance of subjects of different ages, ranging from children (3–6) to adolescents (8–12) to adults (>21). The simulation model performs similarly to the subjects of different ages. Our conclusion is that the validity of the mental model approach is confirmed for the deductive reasoning domain, and that it is possible to devise a unique mechanism able to deal with the specific subareas.

While steel may be expected to have superior fracture stability due to its higher elastic modulus; titanium alloy has experimentally demonstrated improved biomechanical stability, as measured by gap closure and nail slippage. The purpose of this study was to verify these observations computationally, and thus, explain why titanium alloy may be better suited for surgical fixation of fractured femurs. A finite element model of a femur with complete mid-diaphyseal fracture and having two 3.5mm nails in a retrograde “C” pattern was created. Static analyses were run in which the nail material properties were titanium alloy or stainless steel, respectively. Gap closure for the stainless steel nails was 1.03mm; while the titanium alloy nails had 0.69mm of closure. Titanium alloy nails slipped slightly less at each loading increment than stainless steel nails. The titanium alloy nails distributed stress more evenly along the nail axis, resulting in lower peak magnitudes. These results agree with previously published clinical and biomechanical studies that reported increased gap closure and nail slippage with stainless steel nails. The increased deformation of the titanium alloy nail likely increases the contact area with the intramedullary canal wall, thus, increasing stability. Additionally, stainless steel nails had higher curve apex von Mises stresses, potentially inducing a stress-shielding effect which could hamper remodeling and consequently increase risk of re-fracture.",,"Finite element method, Simulated pediatric femur fractures, Intramedullary nails, Biomechanical stability"

Instead of the “creative design” approach in the scenario making in traditional PSS and recent Geodesign frameworks, the Smart Design method applies the optimization algorithms to search for optimal design solutions in the design space. It integrates the design thinking, computational performance modeling and optimization techniques to efficiently and effectively approximate optimal designs. This method is applied to a hypothetical residential neighborhood design case study with three sustainability objectives: to maximize FAR, to minimize building energy use, and to minimize outdoor human discomfort. Based on the form parameterization, the Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) algorithm is utilized to guide the evolution of the neighborhood design throughout 80 generations, with neighborhood performance modeling tools. The Smart Design method is able to identify 38 representative design solutions as Pareto optimal which are equally optimal. Those solutions set a basis for discussions and negotiations among stake holders to make design decisions with the three objectives.

However, existing research on post-quality assessment suffers from the following problems: (1) They are often categorization tasks that rely solely on unimodal data, which inadequately captures information in multimodal contexts and fails to differentiate the quality of students’ posts finely. (2) They ignore the noise in the multimodal deep fusion between posts and topics, which may produce misleading information for the model. (3) They do not adequately capture the complex and fine-grained relationships between post and topic, resulting in an inaccurate evaluation, such as relevance and comprehensiveness. Based on the above challenges, the Multimodal Fine-grained Topic-post Relational Reasoning(MFTRR) framework is proposed for modeling fine-grained cues by simulating the human thinking process. It consists of the local–global semantic correlation reasoning module and the multi-level evidential relational reasoning module. Specifically, MFTRR addresses the challenge of unimodal and categorization task limitations by framing post-quality assessment as a ranking task and integrating multimodal data to more effectively distinguish quality differences. To capture the most relevant semantic relationships, the Local–Global Semantic Correlation Reasoning Module enables deep interactions between posts and topics at both local and global scales. It is complemented by a topic-based maximum information fusion mechanism to filter out noise. Furthermore, to model complex and subtle relational reasoning, the Multi-Level Evidential Relational Reasoning Module analyzes topic-post relationships at both macro and micro levels by identifying critical cues and delving into granular relational cues. MFTRR is evaluated using three newly curated multimodal topic-post datasets, in addition to the publicly available Lazada-Home dataset. Experimental results indicate that MFTRR outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a 9.52% improvement in the NDCG@3 metric compared to the best text-only method on the Art History course dataset.",,"Multimodal data analysis, Forum posts, Post evaluation"

Innovations in risk and resilience assessment have helped communities to identify gaps in their flood risk management strategy but selecting and implementing resilience solutions remains a big challenge for many decision-makers. In addition to traditional appraisals and cost-benefit assessments this also calls for a participatory process in which various stakeholders are encouraged to adopt a system-level approach in identifying interventions that can maximise a range of benefits and co-benefits. In this study, we investigate how a combination of modelling and measurement methods can help decision-makers with their flood resilience strategies. We apply a participatory system thinking approach combining Fuzzy Cognitive Mapping (FCM) with a flood resilience measurement framework called Flood Resilience Measurement for Communities (FRMC). We first investigate stakeholders' biases on flood resilience interventions, and then lead them through a system thinking exercise using FCM and FRMC to elicit mental models representing important aspects of flood resilience and their interrelation. These are then aggregated, representing the collective perceptions and knowledge of stakeholders, and used to identify the most beneficial resilience actions in terms of direct and indirect impacts on flood resilience. We apply this approach to the case of Lowestoft, a coastal town in England exposed to significant flood risk. Developed in close collaboration with the local authorities, the ambition is to support decision-making on flood resilience interventions. We find that this combination of methods enables system-level thinking and inclusive decision-making about flood resilience which can ultimately encourage transformative decisions on prioritization of actions and investments.",,"Flood resilience, Participatory decision making, Resilience measurement tool, Mind mapping, Fuzzy cognitive mapping"

Others point out the biases and cognitive distortions inherent in disregarding information. Researchers have used both simulations and experiments to study how the use of heuristics affects the decision's outcome. However, a good decision is determined by the process and not a lucky outcome. It is a conscious reflection on the decision-maker's information and preferences. Therefore, a heuristic must be assessed by its ability to match a structured decision processing all available information. Thus, the question remains: how often does the reduction of information considered in heuristic decisions lead to a different recommended alternative? We applied different heuristics to a dataset of 945 real, personal decisions. We have found that by using heuristics instead of a fully developed decision structure, in 60.34% of cases, a different alternative would have been recommended to the decision-maker leading to a mean relative utility loss for the deviating decisions of 34.58%.

Our approach is designed to avoid getting stuck in local optima. Specifically, selective opposition obtains the proximity dimension of a candidate solution through a linearly decreasing threshold. Dynamic opposition further extends the process of investigating the solution space. The algorithm is fully incorporated with the differential creative search algorithm for dual-strategy scenarios to enhance the performance of the decision-making effectiveness, population diversity, exploitation capability of the PSO. Finally, an attraction-rejection optimization strategy is introduced to further obtain a good exploitation-exploration balance capability and avoid stagnation of the algorithm. In addition, the comparison results with eight advanced optimization algorithms and six improved particle swarm optimization algorithms on CEC2020 test sets, and the statistical analysis was conducted by Wilcoxon rank sum test. It illustrate the features of the MSFPSO developed within this research strong competitiveness. The convergence of the algorithm was verified at maximum iterations of 10000 on the CEC2017 test set. Meanwhile, the experimental outcomes of applying MSFPSO to 50 practical engineering design challenges prove its effectiveness and strong applicability. The test results and numerical computations manifest that the MSFPSO algorithm with strong competitiveness will become a preferred class of meta-heuristic algorithms to tackle issues within the realm of engineering optimization.",,"Particle swarm optimization, Cauchy variation, Joint adversarial selection, Differential creative search, Attraction-rejection, Algorithm fusion"

Yet, when matching the opponent’s action would lead to a low payoff and the researcher asks for the belief about this opponent, ex-post rationalization kicks in and beliefs are re-adjusted again. Hence, we recommend to ask about unrelated others or about the population in such cases, as ‘opponent beliefs’ are even more detached from the beliefs participants had when deciding about their actions in the corresponding game.

Public policy decisions on natural hazard mitigation can benefit from computational models that embody a comprehensive view of the system. Such models need to be transparent and integrate both expert and lay expert knowledge and experience in an efficient manner. By integrating hard and soft sciences within an overall systems framework, scientists, policy makers and communities can better understand how to improve adaptive capacity. We present a fuzzy cognitive map based Auto-Associative Neural Networks framework generated from a development mixed method integration (triangulation) for adaptive policy formulations. The specific policies relate to preparation for, response to, and recovery from earthquakes in mountainous ski-field environments – a case study chosen to highlight the framework. Three different data collection techniques – expert geomorphic assessments, semi-structured qualitative interviews with three stakeholder groups (experts and lay experts), and fuzzy cognitive maps (FCM) (node and arc maps of stakeholder perceptions) were employed. FCM were first analysed using Graph theory indices to determine map structure. Special attention was paid to subsequent processing of fuzzy cognitive maps (e.g., condensation and aggregation) with qualitative followed by quantitative means to simplify the FCM from the original total of 300 variables to 5 high-level themes to improve the efficacy of subsequent policy simulations. Specifically, the use of Self Organising Maps (SOM) to group concepts (condensation) and individual stakeholders (aggregation) into social group FCMs is a novel contribution to advancing FCM. In the process, SOM also enabled the embedment of nonlinear relationships inherent in the system in the simplified FCM allowing a platform for realistic and meaningful policy simulations based on collective perceptions. Specifically, each of the three simplified stakeholder group FCM and a total social group FCM was represented by Auto-Associative Neural Networks (AANN) which converts an FCM into a dynamical system that allows policy scenario simulations based on input from both expert and lay expert stakeholders. A policy scenario is the level of importance given to a set of concepts and their effects on the system behaviour as revealed by the simulations. We present the results from one of several policy simulations to highlight the effectiveness of the mixed-method integration leading to simplified-FCM based ANNN simulations. Results revealed the similarities and differences between stakeholder group responses in relation to the scenario analysed and how these formed collective responses in the total social group map. Furthermore, outcomes of group and total social group simulations could be interpreted from individual and group stakeholder FCMs giving credibility to the mixed-method approach.",,"Fuzzy cognitive maps, Auto-Associative Neural Networks, Self-organizing maps, Natural hazard mitigation, Earthquakes, Mixed-method triangulation, Policy simulation"

The study is based on a seven-month ethnographical work that details the implementation of a robot in two preschool groups of children aged 1–2 and 3–5 (n = 38). The study descriptively combines a framework for children's play analysis with explorative qualitative child interviews (n = 6) with the 3-5-year-olds to examine how children play with the robot and their thinking about a future with robots and AI. The results show how children's play with robots spans all of Hughes's (2011) sixteen play types and integrates robots into play in ways specific to child-robot interaction. The interviews indicate that children have well-formed knowledge about the current uses of robots and AI and elaborate imaginaries about a future with them, including critical boundaries toward robots and AI agents.

Bayesian Updating predicted instances where particular learning sequences were more likely to engender escalation and persistence under extinction conditions. All simulations revealed greater rates of escalation and persistence in the presence of heterogeneous (e.g., both Wins and Losses) lag sequences, with substantially increased rates of escalation when lags comprised predominantly of losses were followed by wins.

Unlike previous studies, we use a number of different measures of impulsiveness, as well as measures of cognitive ability and analytic thinking style. Overall, impulsiveness is clearly related to CRT performance at the bivariate level. However, once cognitive ability and analytic thinking style are controlled, these relations become small and, in some cases, non-significant. Thus, dispositional impulsiveness, in and of itself, is not a strong predictor of CRT performance.",,"Cognitive reflection, Impulsiveness, Intuitive thinking, Delay discounting dual process"

Brazil is one of the world's largest producers and exporters of chicken. Aiming to improve and sustain a competitive advantage, producers have invested in improvements in production systems in general, in particular aviary heating systems. However, producers need to choose the best among several alternatives of energy sources for heating. This decision impacts the environment to a greater or a lesser extent depending on the energy source chosen. The aim of this study is to develop a computational model to understand systemically and dynamically the environmental externalities based on the choice of energy source for aviary heating. The identification of criteria that influence the choice for heating systems was possible through a multiple case-study in the southern region of Brazil. By designing a computational model of system dynamics, it was possible to visualize scenarios using different energy sources and their respective negative environmental externalities. From the analysis of four scenarios, we sought to identify the one with the best relation to environmental and economic performance. It was evidenced that the scenario with the best relation was that using pellets as an energy source for aviary heating. The developed model may be applied to solve similar decision-making problems.",,"Broiler, Environmental externalities, Energy sources, Systems thinking, System dynamics"

Biologists are co-opting mathematical and computational techniques developed to address these data and derive meaningful interpretations. These developments have led to new disciplines: systems and synthetic biology. To explore these two evolving branches of biology one needs to be familiar with technologies such as genomics, bioinformatics and proteomics, mathematical and computational modeling techniques that help predict the dynamic behavior of the biological system, ruling out the trial-and-error methods of traditional genetic engineering. Systems and synthetic biology have developed hand-in-hand towards building artificial biological devices using engineered biological units as basic building blocks. Systems biology is an integrated approach for studying the dynamic and complex behaviors of biological components, which may be difficult to interpret and predict from properties of individual constituents making up the biological systems. While, synthetic biology aims to engineer biologically inspired devices, such as cellular regulatory circuits that do not exist in nature but are designed using well characterized genes, proteins and other biological components in appropriate combinations to perform a desired function. This is analogous to an electronic circuit board design that is fabricated using well characterized electrical components such as resistors, capacitors and so on. The in silico abstractions and predictions should be tightly linked to experimentation to be proved in vitro and in vivo systems for their successful applications in biotechnology. This chapter focuses on mathematical approaches and computational tools available to engineer biological regulatory circuits and how they can be implemented as next generation therapeutics in infectious disease.",Bentham Science Publishers,"Abstraction, bioengineering, bioinspired, biological parts, computational modelling, computational tools, constructs, dynamic, infectious disease, interdisciplinary, linearization, mathematical framework, nextgen therapeutics, omics, ordinary differential equations, parameters, physical systems, reactions, regulatory circuits, simulation"

Our qualitative analysis shows how children do not make sense of feedback as semantic communication from the system, but make sense of it with respect to its embeddedness in a sequence of activities they are performing with the system and each other. The principal contribution to emerge from our study is a conception of feedback as a process, rather than as a semantic communicative event, nor a direct coupling of action and system response.

A project-specific questionnaire, the Maker Mindsets Scale, was employed to facilitate self-assessment of Maker mindsets before and after intervention. Additionally, teachers' post-lesson discussion meetings were observed, and semi-structured interviews with participating teachers were conducted to gauge their perceptions of students' Maker mindsets transformation. The analysis encompassed students' semi-structured reflection logs and interviews to uncover the underlying factors driving Maker mindsets transformation. The results revealed distinct variations in how students of different abilities perceived their Maker mindsets transformation. Nonetheless, participant teachers consistently observed transformations in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) thinking skills, self-efficacy, motivation, and collaborative learning across all students. The study further identifies a collaborative convergence of multiple factors contributing to Maker mindsets transformation, spanning teacher, student, and pedagogical perspectives.

Our model is based on the model of Marinier, Laird, and Lewis (2009). We modified it by increasing the agent’s visual field, adding a GOFAI-style cognitive module (sub-goal management) and expanding the environment by a high-threat tile, to which the agent responds with a hard-wired automatic reaction. This allowed us to generate and observe different types of behavior and study interesting interactions between cognitive and affective control.

Hence, a sustainability assessment framework for buildings that accounts for the interdependencies amongst social, economic and environmental aspects is essential. Further, buildings also undergo several time-induced changes in their characteristics, such as changes in electricity consumption, material properties, surrounding infrastructure and energy mix that can influence their sustainability. Therefore, this paper introduces a system dynamics-based methodological framework for Dynamic Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment (D-LCSA) capable of incorporating the dynamic changes in the building characteristics with time and capturing the interactions amongst different sustainability indicators. The usability and utility of the framework is demonstrated using a case study residential project in India. The case study results show that ignoring time-dependant dynamic aspects in sustainability assessment of buildings leads to underestimating the overall sustainability impacts by about 50 per cent and specific environmental impacts by about 12 per cent. Therefore, the study reinforces the need to adopt dynamic thinking through modelling and simulation to predict sustainability performance in the built environment.",,"Sustainability assessment, System dynamics, Dynamic life cycle sustainability assessment (D-LCSA), Computational modelling, Life cycle assessment"

Theories that attempt to explain this phenomenon should account for the fact that conceptual knowledge is not static. In line with this thinking, many studies suggest that the representation of a concept changes depending on context. Traditionally, concepts have been studied as vectors within a geometric space, sometimes called Semantic-Vector Space Models (S-VSMs). However, S-VSMs have certain limitations in emulating human biases or context effects when the similarity of concepts is judged. Such limitations are related to the use of a classical geometric approach that represents a concept as a point in space. Recently, some theories have proposed the use of sequential projections of subspaces based on Quantum Probability Theory (Busemeyer and Bruza, 2012; Pothos et al., 2013). They argue that this theoretical approach may facilitate accounting for human similarity biases and context effects in a more natural way. More specifically, Pothos and Busemeyer (2011) proposed the Quantum Similarity Model (QSM) to determine expectation in conceptual spaces in a non-monotonic logic frame. To the best of our knowledge, previous data-driven studies have used the QSM subspaces in a unidimensional way.

However, the difficulty associated with the identification of the circuit in the case of atypical AFL motivates the development of diagnostic techniques. We propose body surface phase map analysis as a noninvasive tool to identify AFL circuits. Sixty seven lead body surface recordings were acquired in 9 patients during AFL (i.e. 3 typical, 6 atypical). Computed body surface phase maps from simulations of 5 reentrant behaviors in a realistic atrial structure were also used. Surface representation of the macro-reentrant activity was analyzed by tracking the singularity points (SPs) in surface phase maps obtained from band-pass filtered body surface potential maps. Spatial distribution of SPs showed significant differences between typical and atypical AFL. Whereas for typical AFL patients 70.78 ± 16.17% of the maps presented two SPs simultaneously in the areas defined around the midaxialliary lines, this condition was only satisfied in 5.15 ± 10.99% (p < 0.05) maps corresponding to atypical AFL patients. Simulations confirmed these results. Surface phase maps highlights the reentrant mechanism maintaining the arrhythmia and appear as a promising tool for the noninvasive characterization of the circuit maintaining AFL. The potential of the technique as a diagnosis tool needs to be evaluated in larger populations and, if it is confirmed, may help in planning ablation procedures.",,"Atrial flutter, Phase map, Cardiac model, Body surface potential mapping"

At present, emerging chemical and microbial drinking water contaminants are not assessed in a systematic way, but reactively and incidence based. Furthermore, they are assessed separately despite similar pollution sources. As a result, risks might be addressed ineffectively. Integrated risk assessment approaches are thus needed that elucidate the uncertainties in the risk evaluation of emerging drinking water contaminants, while considering risk assessors’ values. This study therefore aimed to (1) construct an assessment hierarchy for the integrated evaluation of the potential risks from emerging chemical and microbial contaminants in drinking water and (2) develop a decision support tool, based on the agreed assessment hierarchy, to quantify (uncertain) risk scores. A multi-actor approach was used to construct the assessment hierarchy, involving chemical and microbial risk assessors, drinking water experts and members of responsible authorities. The concept of value-focused thinking was applied to guide the problem-structuring and model-building process. The development of the decision support tool was done using Decisi-o-rama, an open-source Python library. With the developed decision support tool (uncertain) risk scores can be calculated for emerging chemical and microbial drinking water contaminants, which can be used for the evidence-based prioritisation of actions on emerging chemical and microbial drinking water risks. The decision support tool improves existing prioritisation approaches as it combines uncertain indicator levels with a multi-stakeholder approach and integrated the risk assessment of chemical and microbial contaminants. By applying the concept of value-focused thinking, this study addressed difficulties in evidence-based decision-making related to emerging drinking water contaminants.

Network analysis offers a novel approach to investigate the intricate relationships between these symptom dimensions, potentially informing personalized treatment strategies. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted from November 2019 to October 2021, involving 1285 inpatients with schizophrenia in Liaoning Province, China. Symptom severity was assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA-14), and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Network analysis was conducted to investigate the network structure, central symptoms, and bridge symptoms. Results The network analysis uncovered profound interconnectivity between core symptoms and the anxiety-depression community. Central symptoms, such as psychic anxiety, poor rapport, delusions, and attention, were identified as potential therapeutic targets. Bridge symptoms, including insomnia, depressed mood, anxiety-somatic, conceptual disorganization, and stereotyped thinking, emerged as key nodes facilitating interactions between symptom communities. The stability and reliability of the networks were confirmed through bootstrapping procedures. Discussion The findings highlight the complex interplay between schizophrenia symptoms, emphasizing the importance of targeting affective symptoms and cognitive impairment in treatment.

Much of this has either contributed to or relied on the amino acid sequence databases that are now available online, and the data mining approaches that have been developed to analyze these sequences. As the quality of sequence data is generally high, it follows that it is the design of the computational and graphical methodologies that are of especial importance to researchers who aspire to gain a greater understanding of those sequence features that specify both function and structural hierarchy. However, these techniques are necessarily subject to limitations and it is important that these be recognized. In addition, no single method is likely to be successful in solving a particular problem, and a coordinated approach using a suite of methods is generally required. A final step in the process involves the interpretation of the results obtained and the construction of a working model or hypothesis that suggests further experimentation. While such methods allow meaningful progress to be made it is still important that the data are interpreted correctly and conservatively. New data mining methods are continually being developed, and it can be expected that even greater understanding of the relationship between structure and function will be gleaned from sequence data in the coming years.",Academic Press,"IF chain assembly, Sequence periodicities, Heptad and hendecad substructure, Interchain ionic interactions, IF secondary and tertiary structure, Structural/functional motifs, Mutations"

Memory replay mechanisms in non-REM can abstract rules from corpuses of learned information, while replay in REM may promote novel associations. We propose that the iterative interleaving of REM and non-REM across a night boosts the formation of complex knowledge frameworks, and allows these frameworks to be restructured, thus facilitating creative thought.

Methods The subjects were patients aged > 18 years without pre-onset severe disability who developed primary putaminal and/or thalamic hemorrhage and underwent an inpatient rehabilitation program. As explanatory variables, 43 values related to patient background, imaging-related findings, systemic conditions, neurological findings, and blood tests were acquired within 10 days of onset. As an objective variable, the functional outcome at discharge to home or nursing home was acquired using a ternary classification. The dataset consisting of the collected information was split into a training dataset and a test dataset with a ratio of 2:1. A predictive model using a balanced random forest algorithm was created using supervised learning from the training dataset. The predictive performance was validated using a test dataset.

This research aims to contribute to the redefinition of the discourse on the role of estuary planning for changing climate, focusing on four critical aspects: identify the impacts of urbanisation and industrialisation on ecosystems and its correlation with climate hazard at the estuary; visualise such transformations over time and space to identify critical spatial and climate factors threatening inhabitation; propose strategic spatial practices towards adaptation and resilience; and synthesising the options to foster reflective thinking and establish a correlation with novel policies, governance and practices. The study highlights that adopting new urbanism aligned with cultural and ecological principles can mitigate future climate impacts through re-naturalisation and urban adaptation to sea-level rise by focusing on proactive approaches to building resilient communities.

Although cyclist safety represents a critical research area, this ‘systems thinking’ approach has received less attention in bicycle crash analysis. This article presents the findings from a systematic literature review which aimed to synthesise the peer reviewed literature regarding bicycle crash contributory factors (defined as factors which play a contributory role in bicycle crashes, as opposed to risk factors which are factors which may increase the probability of crashes). Crash contributory factors were extracted from included articles and mapped onto a systems thinking framework comprising seven hierarchical road transport system levels. The findings show that a majority of the included studies identified contributory factors relating to the road environment, cycling infrastructure, and cyclist and driver behaviour. No studies identified contributory factors outside of cyclists and road users, bicycles and vehicles, and the road environment and few specifically examined causal relationships between contributory factors. It is concluded that there are gaps in the knowledge base regarding the broader transport system features that play a role in bicycle crashes and how contributory factors interact to create crashes.

This thereby grants us the power to transform the surrounding world and extend our human attributes beyond what is currently possible. Creative ideas are not just new and unexpected, but are also successful in providing solutions that are useful, efficient and valuable. Thus, creativity optimizes the use of available resources and increases wealth. The origin of human creativity, however, is poorly understood, and semantic measures that could predict the success of generated ideas are currently unknown. Here, we analyze a dataset of design problem-solving conversations in real-world settings by using 49 semantic measures based on WordNet 3.1 and demonstrate that a divergence of semantic similarity, an increased information content, and a decreased polysemy predict the success of generated ideas. The first feedback from clients also enhances information content and leads to a divergence of successful ideas in creative problem solving. These results advance cognitive science by identifying real-world processes in human problem solving that are relevant to the success of produced solutions and provide tools for real-time monitoring of problem solving, student training and skill acquisition.

The BRDS is widely ignored in the literature because it imposes disadvantage for the single objective knapsack problem (KP) in terms of memory requirements. The FRDS based DP algorithm in a general sense is related to state dominance checking, which can be time consuming for the MKP while it can be done efficiently for the KP. Consequently, no algorithm purely based on the FRDS with state dominance checking has ever been developed for the MKP. In this paper, we attempt to get some insights into the state reduction techniques efficient to the MKP. We first propose an FRDS based algorithm with a local state dominance checking for the MKP. Then we evaluate the relative advantage of the BRDS and FRDS based algorithms by analyzing their computational time and memory requirements for the MKP.

But to act effectively we need to accurately sense what we can and cannot control. Classic theories across cognitive science suppose that this ‘sense of agency’ is constructed from the sensorimotor signals we experience as we interact with our surroundings. But these sensorimotor signals are inherently ambiguous, and can provide us with a distorted picture of what we can and cannot influence. Here we investigate one way that agents like us might overcome the inherent ambiguity of these signals: by combining noisy sensorimotor evidence with prior beliefs about control acquired through explicit communication with others. Using novel tools to measure and model control decisions, we find that explicit beliefs about the controllability of the environment alter both the sensitivity and bias of agentic choices; meaning that we are both better at detecting and more biased to feel control when we are told to expect it. These seemingly paradoxical effects on agentic choices can be captured by a computational model where expecting to be in control exaggerates the sensitivity or ‘gain’ of the mechanisms we use to detect our influence over our surroundings – making us increasingly sensitised to both true and illusory signs of agency. In combination, these results reveal a cognitive and computational mechanism that allows public communication about what we can and cannot influence to reshape our private sense of control.",,"Agency, Control, Expectation, Prediction, Communication"

Computational complexity, in this regard, comes to the foreground by providing applicable sets of ideas or integrative paradigms to recognize and understand the complex systems' intricate properties. Thus, while making the appropriate, adaptable and evolutive decisions in complex dynamic systems, it is essential to acknowledge different degrees of acceptance of the problems and construct the model it to account for its inherent constraints or limits. In this respect, while hypothesis-driven research has its inherent limitations regarding the investigation of multifactorial and heterogeneous diseases, a data-driven approach enables the examination of the way variables impact one another, which paves the way for the interpretation of dynamic and heterogeneous mechanisms of diseases. Fractional Calculus (FC), in this scope characterized by complexity, provides the applicable means and methods to solve integral, differential and integro-differential equations so FC enables the generalization of integration and differentiation possible in a flexible and consistent manner owing to its capability of reflecting the systems' actual state properties, which exhibit unpredictable variations. The fractional integration and differentiation of fractional-order is capable of providing better characterization of nonstationary and locally self-similar attributes in contrast to constant-order fractional calculus. It becomes possible to model many complex systems by fractional-order derivatives based on fractional calculus so that related syntheses can be realized in a robust and effective way. To this end, our study aims at providing an intermediary facilitating function both for the physicians and individuals by establishing accurate and robust model based on the integration of fractional-order calculus and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for the diagnostic and differentiability predictive purposes with the diseases which display highly complex properties. The integrative approach we have proposed in this study has a multistage quality the steps of which are stated as follows: first of all, the Caputo fractional-order derivative, one of the fractional-order derivatives, has been used with two-parametric Mittag-Leffler function on the stroke dataset and cancer cell dataset, manifesting biological and neurological attributes. In this way, new fractional models with varying degrees have been established. Mittag-Leffler function, with its distributions of extensive application domains, can address irregular and heterogeneous environments for the solution of dynamic problems; thus, Mittag-Leffler function has been opted for accordingly. Following this application, the new datasets (mlf_stroke dataset and mlf_cancer cell dataset) have been obtained by employing Caputo fractional-order derivative with the two-parametric Mittag-Leffler function (α,β). In addition, classical derivative (calculus) was applied to the raw datasets; and cd_stroke dataset and cd_cancer cell dataset were obtained. Secondly, the performance of the new datasets as obtained from the Caputo fractional derivative with the two-parametric Mittag-Leffler function, the datasets obtained from the classical derivative application and the raw datasets have been compared by using feed forward back propagation (FFBP) algorithm, one of the algorithms of ANN (along with accuracy rate, sensitivity, precision, specificity, F1-score, multiclass classification (MCC), ROC curve). Based on the accuracy rate results obtained from the application with FFBP, the Caputo fractional-order derivative model that is most suitable for the diseases has been generated. The experimental results obtained demonstrate the applicability of the complex-systems-grounded paradigm scheme as proposed through this study, which has no existing counterpart. The integrative multi-stage method based on mathematical-informed framework with comparative differentiability prediction analyses can point toward a new direction in the various areas of applied sciences to address formidable challenges of critical decision making and management of chaotic processes in different complex dynamic systems.",Academic Press,"Complexity, Artificial neural network, Classical calculus, Computational complexity, Data-driven fractional modeling, Differentiability prediction analyses, Fractional calculus, Mathematical biology and neuroscience, Mittag-Leffler function, Optimized fractional-order calculus"

Central to this approach are structure-function flow diagrams, which offer a visual representation of how specific neuroanatomical structures are linked to their functional roles. These diagrams are instrumental in mapping the intricate connections between different brain regions, providing a clearer understanding of how functions emerge from the underlying neural architecture. The study details innovative attempts to develop new functional hierarchies that integrate structural and functional data. These efforts leverage recent advancements in neuroimaging techniques such as fMRI, EEG, MEG, and PET, as well as computational models that simulate neural dynamics. By combining these approaches, the study seeks to create a more refined and dynamic hierarchy that can accommodate the brain’s complexity, including its capacity for plasticity and adaptation. A significant focus is placed on the overlap of structures and functions within the brain. The manuscript acknowledges that many brain regions are multifunctional, contributing to different cognitive and behavioral processes depending on the context. This overlap highlights the need for a flexible, non-linear hierarchy that can capture the brain’s intricate functional landscape. Moreover, the study examines the interdependence of these functions, emphasizing how the loss or impairment of one function can impact others. Another crucial aspect discussed is the brain’s ability to compensate for functional deficits following neurological diseases or injuries. The investigation explores how the brain reorganizes itself, often through the recruitment of alternative neural pathways or the enhancement of existing ones, to maintain functionality despite structural damage. This compensatory mechanism underscores the brain’s remarkable plasticity, demonstrating its ability to adapt and reconfigure itself in response to injury, thereby ensuring the continuation of essential functions. In conclusion, the study presents a system of brain functions that integrates structural, functional, and dynamic perspectives. It offers a robust framework for understanding how the brain’s complex network of structures supports a wide range of cognitive and behavioral functions, with significant implications for both basic neuroscience and clinical applications.",,"Brain theory, Functions, Hierarchies, Ontologies, Connectomics, Imaging, Modeling, Simulation, Computational neuroscience, Neuronal dynamics, Behavior"

While such models are typically focussed on macro-patterns, often in cellular or linearly-organised spaces, few models exist for predicting where people will cluster within complex environments. One reason for this relates to the inherent uncertainty associated with spatial attributes and consequently of human spatial behaviours. The present paper draws on the concept of fuzzy spatial objects to develop an approach to handle such uncertainty in architecture. Focussing on large, open plan spaces, where the configuration of space does not define strict patterns of usage, the paper proposes a computational model for predicting patterns of spatial inhabitation. This new model relies on the theory of fuzzy sets to propose the existence of a “fuzzy architectural spatial object, (FASO)” which is comprised of spatial units with degrees of membership that reflect the possibility of a person being present in a sub-space or involved in a sub-function within a larger space. This model calculates and visualises the FASOs using a fuzzy inference engine and represents the space as distributed possibilities of presence according to the given data. After describing the model the paper demonstrates its application in the prediction of patterns of usage within a major exhibition space, and then presents a check of the efficacy of this prediction against the actual inhabitation of the space.",,"Fuzzy logic, Fuzzy set, Spatial uncertainty, Occupancy prediction, Open-planned spaces"

Findings from this study suggest that preservice elementary teachers’ conceptions of algebra as subject matter are rather narrow. Most preservice teachers equated algebra with the manipulation of symbols. Very few identified other forms of reasoning – in particular, relational thinking – with the algebra label.

Yet experimental evidence suggests that senders overcommunicate relative to this baseline, revealing more information than predicted in equilibrium. We propose that overcommunication may be due in part to limited cognitive engagement by subjects, captured by level-k thinking. To test this conjecture, we compare two elicitation methods, direct response and the strategy method, holding other elements of the game fixed. Existing experimental studies of cheap talk games use the standard direct response method, while the strategy method—in which subjects make selections for all contingent choices—is believed to encourage more thoughtful decisionmaking. We therefore expect senders to transmit less information with the strategy method than with direct response. In contrast, we find the reverse: the strategy method increased overcommunication. Further examination suggests that this occurred because senders played more naïvely with the strategy method than with direct response. Our findings suggest that the strategy method and direct response do not elicit the same choices in cheap talk games.",,"Strategic information transmission, Sender-receiver games, Strategy method, Laboratory experiment"

Since multiple design alternatives are put forward at this stage, developing advanced evaluation methods is of great importance. Existing methods adopt additive models to integrate evaluation data. They face some inconsistency issues, e.g. inconsistency in the independent assumption and interdependent data, since evaluation criteria are interactional. Fuzzy measure that replaces the additivity with monotonicity has enabled advances in addressing such issues. This work proposes a two-additive fuzzy measure-based information integration approach to product design alternative evaluation for the first time. The evaluation data given by experts are in the form of intuitionistic linguistic numbers. They are more in accordance with the thinking habits of experts because the hesitation degree in linguistic assessment can be revealed. In order to reduce the subjective bias, the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory method combining with grey relational analysis is applied to adjust evaluation data. Then monotonous two-additive fuzzy measure is identified by nonlinear programming using these data. It makes a good trade-off between computational complexity and presentation capability. Hence, evaluation data can be integrated by non-additive Choquet integral for ranking design alternatives. In comparison to additive model-based methods, the extra effect on the simultaneous satisfaction of criteria can be effectively revealed by the proposed approach. And the robustness of it is demonstrated by the sensitivity analysis. A case study on an elevator's design alternative evaluation is conducted to illustrate the feasibility and practicability of the proposed approach.",,"Multi-criteria decision-making, Two-additive fuzzy measure, Information integration, Intuitionistic linguistic number"

In this study, we employed a nested latent variable approach to examine the specific role of mental speed (Gs) and general retrieval ability (Gr) in DT ability, which was assessed by DT tasks that instructed to be creative and were scored for creative quality. Specifically, Gs was assumed to facilitate both Gr and DT, and Gr was assumed to contribute to DT. Successive latent variable models with orthogonal factors were tested to reflect these nested cognitive basic abilities. The proposed model of nested factors fit the data well: Latent Gs accounted for variation in Gs, Gr, and DT creative quality scores, latent Gr predicted performance in Gr and DT scores beyond Gs, and latent DT explained variation in DT scores beyond Gs and Gr. In addition, we related the resulting orthogonal latent variables to the external criteria of school grades to illustrate the explanatory power of the modeling approach.

A matrix-free version of the GMRES algorithm is utilized to solve the equation systems in an implicit manner. The scalability of the computations on a 64-processor Linux cluster is evaluated for moderate to large size problems. A method for estimating the speedup for large-scale problems, where computations on a single processor is not possible, is proposed. Superlinear speedup is observed, perhaps for the first time, for a large-scale problem that is associated with more than 44 million nodes and 176 million equations. The performance of the various subactivities of the program is monitored to investigate the cause. It is found that the formation of the RHS vector and the preconditioner achieves a very high level of superlinear speedup as the number of processors increase. As a result, even though the network time for interprocessor communication increases with increase in processors, an overall superlinear speedup is realized for large-scale problems. The superlinear speedup is attributed to cache related effects. A comparison between the performance of matrix and matrix-free versions of the GMRES algorithm is carried out. It is found that for large-scale applications the matrix-free version outperforms its counterpart for reasonable dimensions of the Kyrylov subspace. The effect of mesh partitioning on the scalability is also studied. A significant reduction in communication time is observed with partitioning that leads to an overall improvement of speedup. The parallel implementation is utilized to study the wake instabilities in flow past a stationary circular cylinder at Re=150, 200 and 300.

The experiments used a concept-selection task in which subjects were required to characterize an event based on a preliminary piece of information and a final, confirmatory piece of information.

Several neurobiological risk factors for schizophrenia (NMDAR and GABAergic interneuron hypofunction) reduce both synaptic and “oscillatory” gain at high hierarchical areas. This could impair the encoding of precision at higher levels of the brain’s hierarchical model and increase expected precision at lower levels. This imbalance can account for many neurobiological and phenomenological findings in schizophrenia. Striatal D2R hyperactivity may increase the precision of current policies by inhibiting behavioral or cognitive switching. This could be a (dysfunctional) consequence of or even an attempt to compensate for prefrontal or hippocampal pathology. This D2R hyperactivity may also reduce learning from positive outcomes and affect the encoding of motivational (or informational) salience.",Academic Press,"Schizophrenia, Bayesian brain, precision, aberrant salience, reversal, predictive coding, NMDAR, GABA, delusions"

Large-scale data processing necessitates substantial computational resources, prompting individuals and enterprises to turn to cloud services. Accompanying this trend is a growing concern regarding data leakage and misuse. Homomorphic encryption (HE) is one solution for safeguarding data privacy, enabling encrypted data to be processed securely in the cloud. However, the encryption and decryption routines of some HE schemes require considerable computational resources, presenting non-trivial work for clients. In this paper, we propose an outsourced decryption protocol for the prevailing RLWE-based fully homomorphic encryption schemes. The protocol splits the original decryption into two routines, with the computationally intensive part executed remotely by the cloud. Its security relies on an invariant of the NTRU-search problem with a newly designed blinding key distribution. Cryptographic analyses are conducted to configure protocol parameters across varying security levels. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed protocol achieves up to a 67% acceleration in the client-side computation, accompanied by a 50% reduction in space usage.",,"Privacy-preserving computation, Outsourced computing, Homomorphic encryption"

Design/methodology/approach The author has revised some of the major issues that are going to determine the direction of the university of the future, i.e. the employment opportunities of tomorrow; the role of new technologies, especially the impact of artificial intelligence (AI); quality in higher education; and internationalization. Findings The author has also pointed out the importance of the technologies and the great role they indisputably play in present and future education at all levels, a fact that has been particularly and hugely enhanced and promoted by the COVID-19 pandemic situation, thereby facilitating and fostering distance learning. This is very much connected to the application of AI to higher education, another unavoidable issue of utmost importance for the university of the future. While these technological advances present a challenge to universities, which must determine which are necessary and desirable and how to implement them, it is, ultimately, our responsibility to use them, in an ethical way, to the benefit of our students. The university of the future also has to be of high quality, and this involves carrying out important and decisive action having to do with matters of inclusion, hiring policies and the expansion of international opportunities for all parties involved.

The meeting was attended by individuals whose specialities range from molecular biology to philosophy. Their common aim was to investigate the role of cognitive neuroscience in establishing a theory of mental processing which combines the knowledge derived from cognitive psychology and from neuroscience. How this synthesis is to be achieved, and indeed the extent to which it is possible, was the subject of wide-ranging and often vigorous debate. But, as many disciplines begin to converge on common problems, the prospects for cognitive neuroscience appear encouraging. Thus, as neuroscientists start to unravel the molecular mechanisms of learning and memory, it is interesting to consider what constraints such mechanisms might place on the operational rules for correlating single-neuron activity and behaviour in invertebrates, it has been argued that similar progress in understanding the mammalian brain will come from the application of models, derived from cognitive psychology, to neurophysiology. Artificial intelligence provides an opportunity to model many cognitive processes, but how close do the models come to reflecting underlying mental states? Indeed, the problem or non-problem of self-awareness dominated many conversations, tantalizing some participants by its intractability and accepted by others as a naturally emergent attribute of the mechanics of the mind.",,

Meanwhile, genetic epidemiology studies are often conducted without consideration of social and environmental context, limiting the public health impact of genomic discoveries. This divide endures despite shared goals and increases in interdisciplinary data due to a lack of shared theoretical frameworks and differing language. Here, we demonstrate that bridging epidemiological divides does not require entirely new ways of thinking. Existing social epidemiology frameworks including Ecosocial theory and Fundamental Cause Theory, can both be extended to incorporate principles from genetic epidemiology. We show that genetic epidemiology can strengthen, rather than detract from, efforts to understand the impact of social determinants of health. In addition to presenting theoretical synergies, we offer practical examples of how genetics can improve the public health impact of epidemiology studies across the field. Ultimately, we aim to provide a guiding framework for trainees and established epidemiologists to think about diseases and complex systems and foster more fruitful collaboration between genetic and traditional epidemiological disciplines.",,

The further step is to bring these 3C resources closer to the mobile user, at the edge of the network, to enable very low latency and high reliability services.

Analytical solutions for the transient response of multidimensional systems exist only for the simplest dynamical systems. The evolution of the transition probability density function over the phase space has been solved numerically for various low dimensional systems subjected to additive and multiplicative white noise excitations using the finite element method. Systems of higher order, however, pose difficulty when using standard finite element formulations due to memory requirements and computational expense. Direct Monte Carlo simulation (MCS), while often regarded as less elegant than other methods, can be used to solve problems of significantly higher complexity. The number of realizations required to accurately produce the transition probability density function over the entire phase space, especially in the tails, is large, but since each realization is entirely independent of the others, the Monte Carlo simulation is easily and efficiently adapted to parallel computation. The advent of high-speed, massively-parallel computers permits a large number of realizations of a complex dynamical system to be simultaneously determined. Consequently, Monte Carlo simulation may be more efficient for higher-dimensional systems than other solution methods currently in use. This investigation will examine some of these observations and compare the performance of MCS on various platforms, in the context of a four-dimensional linear oscillator and a Duffing oscillator subjected to band-limited white noise.",,

To answer this need, this article proposes an innovative approach that combines several methods, including sketch maps, agent-based simulation, and serious games. This combination enables to benefit from these three approaches: the expressiveness of sketch maps and the ability to analyze participants' spatial representations, the capacity of agent-based simulations to aid users in comprehending complex phenomena and dynamics, and the experimental and motivational environment provided by games. To implement this approach, we developed the DYSMA model, which bridges the gap between sketch maps and agent-based simulations by integrating drawn elements as agents, providing a dynamic sketch map. Additionally, we developed the Draw and Flood game, designed to engage the general public in thinking about flood management through the use of dynamic sketch maps.

We show how work that learners do with models can help them to transform, not simply their understanding of key concepts, but also how they come to view themselves as thinkers and learners, as collaborators in a social process that their work and thinking help to constitute.

Rumination, perseverative negative thinking about the past and the self, may contribute to these biases. Methods 159 adolescents (12–18 years), with a range of depression symptoms, completed the SRET during fMRI. Multiple regressions tested associations between conventional self-report and ecological momentary assessment (EMA) measured rumination, and neural and behavioral responses during a self-referent encoding task (SRET). Results Higher rumination (conventional self-report and EMA) was associated with more negative and fewer positive words endorsed and recalled. Higher self-reported (but not EMA) rumination was associated with higher accuracy in recognizing negative words and greater insula and dorsal anterior cingulate activity to negative versus positive words. Limitations The sample included mostly non-Hispanic White participants with household incomes above the national average, highlighting the need for replication in more diverse samples. Word endorsement discrepancies required fMRI analyses to model neural response to viewing negative versus positive words. Conclusions Adolescents with higher rumination endorsed and recalled more negative and fewer positive words and recognized more negative words during the SRET. Higher insula reactivity, a key region for modulating externally-oriented attention and internally-oriented self-referential processes, may contribute to links between rumination and negative memory biases.

The theory of cognitive control specifies a set of required computational functions and their abstract inputs and outputs, while the appraisal theory specifies in more detail the nature of these inputs and outputs and an ontology for their representation. We argue that there is a surprising functional symbiosis between these two independently motivated theories that leads to a deeper theoretical integration than has been previously obtained in other computational treatments of cognition and emotion. We use an implemented model in Soar to test the feasibility of the resulting integrated theory, and explore its implications and predictive power in several task domains.",,

In order to show this, I focus on the transition that the investigations on the worm C. elegans experienced in the Laboratory of Molecular Biology of Cambridge (UK). Throughout the 1980s, this research programme evolved from a study of the genetic basis of the worm’s development and behaviour to a DNA mapping and sequencing initiative. By examining the changing computing technologies which were used at the Laboratory, I demonstrate that by the time of this transition researchers shifted from modelling the worm’s genetic programme on a mainframe apparatus to writing minicomputer programs aimed at providing map and sequence data which was then circulated to other groups working on the genetics of C. elegans. The shift in the worm research should thus not be simply explained in the application of computers which transformed the project from hypothesis-driven to a data-intensive endeavour. The key factor was rather a historically specific technology—in-house and easy programmable minicomputers—which redefined the way of achieving the project’s long-standing goal, leading the genetic programme to co-evolve with the practices of data production and distribution.",,", Genetics, Computer, Program, Software, Data, Genomics, Model organism"

The CSM approach combines the problem framing features of causal mapping with a dialectical inquiry process patterned after Churchman's.

Coding is now being taught to primary-school children worldwide, but current medical students usually lack coding skills, and current measures of computer literacy for medical students focus on the use of software and internet safety. There is a need to train a cohort of doctors who can both practice medicine and engage in the development of useful, innovative technologies to increase efficiency and adapt to the modern medical world. Objective The aim of the study was to address the following questions: (1) is it possible to teach undergraduate medical students the basics of computer coding in a 2-day course? (2) how do students perceive the value of learning computer coding at medical school? and (3) do students see computer coding as an important skill for future doctors? Methods We developed a short coding course to teach self-selected cohorts of medical students basic coding. The course included a 2-day introduction on writing software, discussion of computational thinking, and how to discuss projects with mainstream computer scientists, and it was followed on by a 3-week period of self-study during which students completed a project. We explored in focus groups (FGs) whether students thought that coding has a place in the undergraduate medical curriculum. Results Our results demonstrate that medical students who were complete novices at coding could be taught enough to be able to create simple, usable clinical programs with 2 days of intensive teaching. In addition, 6 major themes emerged from the FGs: (1) making sense of coding, (2) developing the students’ skill set, (3) the value of coding in medicine, research, and business, (4) role of teaching coding in medical schools, (5) the concept of an enjoyable challenge, and (6) comments on the course design. Conclusions Medical students can acquire usable coding skills in a weekend course. They valued the teaching and identified that, as well as gaining coding skills, they had acquired an understanding of its potential both for their own projects and in health care delivery and research.

We examined the effect of sleep quality on same-day HRQOL using ecological momentary assessment methods over a 7-day period. Design Repeated-measures study involving 7 days of home monitoring; participants completed HRQOL measures each night and ecological momentary assessment ratings 3 times throughout the day; multilevel models were used to analyze data. Setting Two academic medical centers. Participants A total of 170 individuals with SCI (N=170). Interventions Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures Daily sleep quality was rated on a scale of 0 (worst) to 10 (best) each morning. Participants completed end-of-day diaries each night that included several HRQOL measures (Sleep Disturbance, Sleep-related Impairment, Fatigue, Cognitive Abilities, Pain Intensity, Pain Interference, Ability to Participate in Social Roles and Activities, Depression, Anxiety) and ecological momentary assessment ratings of HRQOL (pain, fatigue, subjective thinking) 3 times throughout each day. Results Multilevel models indicated that fluctuations in sleep quality (as determined by end-of-day ratings) were significantly related to next-day ratings of HRQOL; sleep quality was related to other reports of sleep (Sleep Disturbance; Sleep-related Impairment; Fatigue) but not to other aspects of HRQOL. For ecological momentary assessment ratings, nights of poor sleep were related to worse pain, fatigue, and thinking. Generally, sleep quality showed consistent associations with fatigue and thinking across the day, but the association between sleep quality and these ecological momentary assessment ratings weakened over the course of the day.

To deal with a continuously changing environment, living things have three choices: (1) evolve unvarying processes that usually succeed, (2) evolve genetically fixed effector, perceptual, and computational functions that are contingent on the environment, and (3) learn adaptive functions during their lifetimes. The theme of this chapter is the relation between (2) and (3): the nature of evolutionarily determined computational processes that support learning. The principal goal of this chapter has been to suggest that high-dimensional vector space computations based on empirical associations among very large numbers of components could be a close model of a fundamental computational basis of most learning in both verbal and perceptual domains. More powerful representational effects can be brought about by linear inductive combinations of the elements of very large vocabularies than has often been realized. Success of one such model to demonstrate many natural properties of language commonly assumed to be essentially more complex, nonlinear, and/or unlearned, along with evidence and argument that similar computations may serve similar roles in object recognition, are taken to reaffirm the possibility that a single underlying associational mechanism lies behind many more special and complex appearing cognitive phenomena.",Academic Press,

Parallel fibers carrying signals positively correlated with climbing-fiber input have their synapses weakened (long-term depression), whereas those carrying signals negatively correlated with climbing input have their synapses strengthened (long-term potentiation). Learning therefore ceases when all parallel-fiber signals have been decorrelated from climbing-fiber input. This is a computationally powerful rule for supervised learning and can be cast in a spike-timing dependent plasticity form for comparison with experimental evidence. Decorrelation learning is particularly well suited to sensory prediction, for example, in the reafference problem where external sensory signals are interfered with by reafferent signals from the organism’s own movements, and the required circuit appears similar to the one found to mediate classical eye blink conditioning. However, for certain stimuli, avoidance is a much better option than simple prediction, and decorrelation learning can also be used to acquire appropriate avoidance movements. One example of a stimulus to be avoided is retinal slip that degrades visual processing, and decorrelation learning appears to play a role in the vestibulo-ocular reflex that stabilizes gaze in the face of unpredicted head movements. Decorrelation learning is thus suitable for both sensory prediction and motor control. It may also be well suited for generic spatial and temporal coordination, because of its ability to remove the unwanted side effects of movement. Finally, because it can be used with any kind of time-varying signal, the cerebellum could play a role in cognitive processing.",Elsevier,"Cerebellum, eye blink conditioning, vestibulo-ocular reflex, spike-timing dependent plasticity, avoidance learning, long-term depression, long-term potentiation, supervised learning, reafference, least mean squares"

To this end, the modeling occurred through the software of the PROMETHEE-SAPEVO-M1 method to clarify the best plants, because of the range of possibilities in the national territory, for project implementation and subsequent production of biomethane for industrial use. As a result, we verified that São Paulo is the best alternative for applying the investment in biomethane production.",,"Multicriteria, PROMETHEE, SAPEVO, Energy, Biomethane"

The linkage between HATS presents a major challenge to the mining industry globally. When the immune system is compromised by HIV/AIDS and silicosis, it makes it easier for tuberculosis to infect the body. In addition, the silica dust which affects the lungs may also cause silicosis and tuberculosis. The objective of this paper is to posit a big data integrated framework to assist in the prevention and control of HATS in the mining industry. Literature was reviewed in order to build a conceptual framework. Although this study is not the first to apply big data in healthcare, to the researcher's knowledge, it is the first to apply big data in understanding the linkage between HATS in the mining industry. The literature review indicates only a few studies using big data in healthcare with no research found on big data and HATS. It therefore makes a contribution to existing body of literature on the control of HATS. The proposed big data framework has the potential of addressing the needs of predictive epidemiology which is important in forecasting and disease control in the mining industry. The paper therefore lays a foundation for the use of viable systems model and big data to address the challenges of HATS in the mining industry. As part of future work, the framework will be validated using sequential explanatory mixed methods case study approach in mining organizations.",,"Tuberculosis, Big Data, HIV/AIDS, Silicosis, Systems Approach, Viable Systems Model, Organizational Cybernetics, Hard Systems Thinking, Soft Systems Thinking, Emancipatory Systems Thinking, Critical Systems Thinking, Epidemiology"

However, this property of multiplication is difficult for students to understand. We used two unique data sets to explore middle school students’ use of the distributive property. Study 1 involved data from 1:1 structured interviews of students (N = 24) discussing worked examples and solving associated practice problems. We examined whether or not students used the distributive property to solve the problems and whether or not interviewers followed the recommended distributive property prompts or defaulted to more conventional methods. Despite exposure to worked examples using the distributive property and a protocol calling for attention to it, students and interviewers favored methods like PEMDAS (parentheses, exponents, multiplication, division, addition, subtraction) or long multiplication. Study 2 used a data set with middle school students’ (N = 131) item-level responses on Kirkland’s (2022; doctoral dissertation, University of Notre Dame) Brief Assessment of Mature Number Sense along with several related measures of domain-general and domain-specific skills. We extracted problems involving the distributive property for analysis. Surprisingly, there was no evidence that students’ use of the distributive property improved from sixth grade to eighth grade. However, both grade-level mathematics achievement and cognitive reflection uniquely predicted the correct use of the distributive property.

The experimental results provides good evidence for the following assertions: (1) knowledge is a necessary part of all acts of depiction done by people of all ages and of all levels of skill, (2) knowledge is a main determinant of looking strategies, (3) the role of knowledge in the organization of looking strategies is one of determining the level of description to be used as the basis of analytic processes, and (4) ""good"" copying performance (i.e., ""accurate"" in terms of scene-specific and view-specific relations) can be equated with level of description accessed. The chapter emphasizes on: (1) each descending level of description implies an increasing disintegration of the analytic task. (2) Analysis for depiction is concerned with variance. It is concerned with relations that change according to viewing circumstances. In effect, they can be considered as novel relations. There is much evidence that people's ability to maintain ""novel"" relations in memory is severely limited.

Our protocol involved 136 engineering students divided into 34 groups which were provided with inspirational cubes illustrating manufacturing inventive principles or basic volumes from the Creative Mental Synthesis Task.

We trace the possible relations between his proto-connectionist notion of ‘organising’ machines in Turing (1948) on the one hand and his mathematical theory of morphogenesis in developmental biology (1952) on the other. These works were concerned with distinct fields of inquiry and followed distinct paradigms of biological theory, respectively postulating analogues of Darwinian selection in learning and mathematical laws of form in organic pattern formation. Still, these strands of Turing’s work are related, first, in terms of being amenable in principle to his (1936) computational method of modelling. Second, they are connected by Turing’s scattered speculations about the possible bearing of learning processes on the anatomy of the brain. We argue that these two theories form an unequal couple that, from different angles and in partial fashion, point towards cognition as a biological and embodied phenomenon while, for reasons inherent to Turing’s computational approach to modelling, not being capable of directly addressing it as such. We explore ways in which these two distinct-but-related theories could be more explicitly and systematically connected, using von Neumann’s contemporaneous and related work on Cellular Automata and more recent biomimetic approaches as a foil. We conclude that the nature of ‘initiative’ and the mode of material realisation are the key issues that decide on the possibility of intelligent machinery in Turing.",,"Universal computing machines, Mechanism, Connectionism, Morphogenesis, D’Arcy Thompson, Darwinian evolution, Cellular automata"

One of the major computational costs associated with TRAC and similar codes is calculating constitutive coefficients. Although the formulations for these coefficients are local, the costs are flow-regime- or data-dependent; i.e., the computations needed for a given spatial node often vary widely as a function of time. Consequently, a fixed, uniform assignment of nodes to parallel processors will result in degraded computational efficiency due to the poor load balancing. A standard method for treating data-dependent models on vector architectures has been to use gather operations (or indirect addressing) to sort the nodes into subsets that (temporarily) share a common computational model. However, this method is not effective on distributed memory data parallel architectures, where indirect addressing involves expensive communication overhead. Another serious problem with this method involves software engineering challenges in the areas of maintainability and extensibility. For example, an implementation that was hand-tuned to achieve good computational efficiency would have to be rewritten whenever the decision tree governing the sorting was modified. Using an example based on the calculation of the wall-to-liquid and wall-to-vapor heat-transfer coefficients for three nonboiling flow regimes, we describe how the use of the Fortran 90 WHERE construct and automatic inlining of functions can be used to ameliorate this problem while improving both efficiency and software engineering. Unfortunately, a general automatic solution to the load-balancing problem associated with data-dependent computations is not yet available for massively parallel architectures. We discuss why developers should either wait for such solutions or consider alternative numerical algorithms, such as a neural network representation, that do not exhibit load-balancing problems.",,

While various approaches, such as energy systems analysis and linear or non-linear optimisation, have been employed to achieve energy sustainability mainly at the national or city level, there has been a lack of focus on achieving energy sustainability in the residential sector through a holistic optimal decision-making approach for efficient HES design. This study focuses on developing a multi-stage optimisation-based decision-making framework that models, quantifies, and optimises the performance indicators of HES, allowing for an assessment of the trade-off between benefits and systems costs under various design scenarios. The initial step involves designing the HES model and constructing scenarios that cater to the electrification requirements of water, energy, and food elements in the residential sector by using a systematic thinking approach. Then, a preliminary evaluation of the modelled scenarios is conducted to assess energy sustainability in terms of technical and economic aspects. Afterwards, an optimal decision-making setup is established by integrating a multi-objective HES model into the NSGA-II algorithm, which approximates the Pareto optimal solutions. These solutions are then ranked by using a multi-criteria decision-making method. According to the findings, the Quetta region in Pakistan contains the best optimal solution. The results underscore the utility of the developed framework in facilitating the optimal design of renewables-integrated HES for the residential sector.

Specifically, these systems aim to construct high-quality approximations of compound decision granules that represent solutions. Here, we present the basis for insightful reasoning realized through approximate reasoning processes grounded in granular computations.

For each directed connection, a signal triggered at the sending clock incurs a (real valued) time delay before arriving at the receiving clock, where it induces an instantaneous phase reset affecting all k-phases. Instantaneous phase resetting maps (PRMs) for k-dimensional clocks have received little attention. The system may be treated as open and subject to periodic, or other types of, PRM forcing at any individual clock, as a result of external forcing stimuli. We show how the full system, with Nk phase variables, responds to such stimuli, as the impact spreads across the entire network. Beyond simulations, we employ methods to reverse engineer the dynamical behaviour of the whole: estimating the intrinsic dimensions of the responses to different experiments; and by analysing pairwise comparisons between those responses. This shows that the system’s responses are governed by a hierarchy of internal dynamical modes, existing across both the Nk phases and over time. We argue that this Kuramoto system is a model for the human cortex, where each k-dimensional clock models the dynamics of a single neural column, which contains 10,000 densely inter-connected neurons. The Kuramoto model exploits the natural network of networks architecture of the human cortex. An array of N=1M such columns/clocks is at the 10B neuron scale of the human cortex. However its simulation is far more accessible than very large scale (VLS) simulations of neuron-to-neuron systems on supercomputers. The latent modes may have important implications for cognition (information processing) and for consciousness (the existence of internal phenomenological experiences). We argue that the existence of the latter plays a key role in preconditioning the former, reducing the decision sets and the cognitive load, and thus enabling a fast-thinking evolutionary advantage. This is the first time that systems of k-dimensional clocks (k> 1), coupled via time-lagged PRMs, within range dependent networks, have been deployed to demonstrate the basic internal phenomenological elements (of consciousness) and their potential role within immediate cognition. Statement of Significance: We argue that this Kuramoto system is a model for the human cortex, where each of 1M k-dimensional clocks models the dynamics of a single neural column (containing 10,000 densely inter-connected neurons). This Kuramoto model exploits the natural network of networks architecture of the human cortex. Large scale human cortex simulations, with 10B neutrons, usually require a super computer. We show that similar results, using this model, can be obtained on a laptop. In particular we show that such dynamical can support internal phenomenological elements (of conscious experience) and we discuss their potential role in preconditioning immediate cognition, furnishing a “fast thinking” evolutionary advantage to the human brain.",,"Kuramoto models, Range-dependent networks, High dimensional clocks, Phase-resetting maps, The human cortex, Consciousness"

By conducting DFT calculations, we can analyze how NMs will behave across different mechanical states, which is critical for designing properties for advanced applications. Problems related to the application of DFT (e.g., high computational cost and failure in modeling defects or exchange-correlation functionals) are discussed. Despite these challenges, DFT must provide insights that complement other tools and strategies. However, further development is essential for improving its quantitative predictability on temperature and multiscale models. Future work is needed to integrate ML with DFT further to refine the accuracy and computational efficiency, thereby extending the capability of DFT to accelerate the discovery of new NMs with superior mechanical properties.",,"DFT, NMs, Elasticity, Mechanical properties, Quantum effects, Surface phenomena"

The twin transition suggests that, to maximize the impact of sustainable solutions, humans and (disruptive) technologies need to be effectively integrated. Methods to conceptually build such (eco)systems integrating these and assess their ecological impact before implementation are lacking. This paper addresses this gap by proposing the Circulise framework, a model-driven method designed to build circular systems and evaluate their environmental performance. The approach promotes design-thinking to create socio-technical ecosystems that can be evaluated at the light of their alignment with circular economy and/or sustainability principles and be used to generate operational software behavior. The Circulise framework was developed following the methodological guidance of design science research. It is applied in this paper to the case of Fanyatu, a non-profit organization focused on reforestation in the Congo Basin, showing its ability to create a circular ecosystem not only supporting the creation of regenerative CO2-absorbing forests but also empowering and improving the quality of life of the local communities involved in the planting of trees. In Fanyatu’s case, Circulise’s strategic planning and technology integration lead to virtuous cycles, enabling a snowball effect in forest creation and the promotion of sustainable projects. The framework’s scalability and versatility allow it to be applied across various contexts, enabling the creation of customized circular ecosystems for sustainability tailored to specific human and technological needs.",,"Circulise, Circular economy development, Cryptocurrency, Reforestation, Sustainability, Sustainability engineering, Twin transition"

We present a tool based on the authors´ original approach focused on solving complex managerial problems affected by the vagueness or uncertainty caused by the human factor. For this purpose, we show the connection between the functioning principle of the tool and processes occurring in the human mind including a description of its structure as perceived by an external observer. This is followed by an overview of selected fragments of fuzzy propositional logic, the theory of fuzzy sets, and the conclusions derived from it. The main part consists of formulating an algebraic description of the computational process of multi-criteria evaluation of the considered alternative performed by a fuzzy system, which serves as the executive unit of a Fuzzy calculator. This is supplemented by a flowchart diagram illustrating the algorithm of its functioning. The Fuzzy calculator distinguishes itself from other fuzzy systems by standardizing all linguistic variables, regardless of the number of linguistic values, into a unified framework comprising three terms L, M, and H, which are represented using trapezoidal fuzzy numbers, ensuring precise mathematical characterization. During the transformation, the original linguistic terms are preserved by incorporating the positions of their support intervals, thereby maintaining the specificity of the input information.

Furthermore, habit formation is proposed as a key mechanism contributing to the development and maintenance of addiction. However, the neural substrates underlying daily habitual tendencies and their contribution to behavioral addiction symptoms in everyday life remain poorly understood. To explore these questions, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of data from 219 individuals who underwent neuroimaging (structural MRI) assessments alongside evaluations of their daily habitual tendencies and symptoms of Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD) and Problematic Smartphone Use (PSU). Using voxel-based morphometry, meta-analytic decoding, and mediation analysis, we found that daily habitual tendencies were positively correlated with larger gray matter volumes in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), precuneus, superior frontal gyrus (SFG), inferior temporal gyrus (ITG), and supplementary motor area (SMA). Notably, the midline regions, including the vmPFC and precuneus, play a crucial role in value-based computation, emotional regulation, social cognition, and self-referential thinking. Individual variations in gray matter volumes within these regions served as mediators, influencing the bidirectional relationship between daily habitual tendencies and IGD symptoms. However, vmPFC variations were specifically found to mediate the pathway from PSU to daily habitual tendencies. Our findings suggest that the morphological architecture of the vmPFC and precuneus is associated with habitual tendencies in daily life and may mediate the development of addictive behaviors.

In terms of the underlying mathematical representation, a more stable Manhattan trajectory-based coding method suitable for a collaborative layout is proposed. Building on this coding method, multiple strategies are incorporated into the heuristic AFSA to enhance its optimization and collaborative performance. Collaborative evaluation functions and methods are designed and refined to ensure effective layout results for multiple objectives. Furthermore, a layout procedure incorporating bidirectional guidance strategies and hierarchical thinking is proposed. This method achieves collaborative layouts through the mutual guidance of optimal objectives. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through representative cases of various types of ship engine rooms in practical engineering.

Secondly, the implementation of the scheme is introduced. Finally, the effectiveness of proposed solution scheme is tested through some numerical examples. The results showcase that the proposed strategy can not only acquire accurate load–displacement responses and crack patterns, but also significantly reduce the computational cost.

Hypersexuality has historically been stigmatized in society and in health care provision, which makes it more difficult for service users to talk about their behaviors. There is a need for greater understanding of hypersexuality to develop better evidence-based treatment, support, and training for health professionals. Objective This study aimed to develop and assess effective methodologies for identifying posts on Reddit related to hypersexuality posted by people with a self-reported bipolar diagnosis. Using natural language processing techniques, this research presents a specialized dataset, the Talking About Bipolar on Reddit Corpus (TABoRC). We used various computational tools to filter and categorize posts that mentioned hypersexuality, forming the Hypersexuality in Bipolar Reddit Corpus (HiB-RC). This paper introduces a novel methodology for detecting hypersexuality-related conversations on Reddit and offers both methodological insights and preliminary findings, laying the groundwork for further research in this emerging field. Methods A toolbox of computational linguistic methods was used to create the corpora and infer demographic variables for the Redditors in the dataset. The key psychological domains in the corpus were measured using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count, and a topic model was built using BERTopic to identify salient language clusters. This paper also discusses ethical considerations associated with this type of analysis. Results The TABoRC is a corpus of 6,679,485 posts from 5177 Redditors, and the HiB-RC is a corpus totaling 2146 posts from 816 Redditors. The results demonstrate that, between 2012 and 2021, there was a 91.65% average yearly increase in posts in the HiB-RC (SD 119.6%) compared to 48.14% in the TABoRC (SD 51.2%) and an 86.97% average yearly increase in users (SD 93.8%) compared to 27.17% in the TABoRC (SD 38.7%). These statistics suggest that there was an increase in posting activity related to hypersexuality that exceeded the increase in general Reddit use over the same period. Several key psychological domains were identified as significant in the HiB-RC (P<.001), including more negative tone, more discussion of sex, and less discussion of wellness compared to the TABoRC. Finally, BERTopic was used to identify 9 key topics from the dataset. Conclusions Hypersexuality is an important symptom that is discussed by people with bipolar on Reddit and needs to be systematically recognized as a symptom of this illness. This research demonstrates the utility of a computational linguistic framework and offers a high-level overview of hypersexuality in bipolar, providing empirical evidence that paves the way for a deeper understanding of hypersexuality from a lived experience perspective.",,"bipolar, hypersexuality, natural language processing, Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count, LIWC, BERTopic, topic modeling, computational linguistics"

Recent hypotheses of the neural code rely on the existence of an ideal observer, whether on specific areas of the cerebral cortex or distributed network composed of cortical and subcortical elements. The Neurobehavioral State hypothesis stipulates that neurons are in a quasi-stable state due to the dynamic interaction of their molecular components. This increases their computational capabilities and electrophysiological behavior further than a binary active/inactive state. Together, neuronal populations across the brain learn to identify and associate internal and external stimuli with actions and emotions. Furthermore, such associations can be stored through the regulation of neuronal components as new quasi-stable states. Using this framework, behavior arises as the result of the dynamic interaction between internal and external stimuli together with previously established quasi-stable states that delineate the behavioral response. Finally, the Neurobehavioral State hypothesis is firmly grounded on present evidence of the complex dynamics within the brain, from the molecular to the network level, and avoids the need for a central observer by proposing the brain configures itself through experience-driven associations.",,"Brain networks, Neuronal dynamics, Neural code, Neurotransmitter, Electrophysiology, Neuronal computation, Behavior"

Results confirmed that a mix of divergence and convergence predicted high performance in a bandit task but not in a purely random task or in a simple repetitive task. These predictions are maintained after controlling for sex, personality, incentives, and other factors. As hypothesized, creative cognition was necessary for high performance under the appropriate conditions. However, it was not necessary to get high grades in a traditional school system.

Much of the current academic scholarship on smart cities offers synoptic and technical perspectives, leaving the users of smart systems curiously unaccounted for. While they purport to empower citizens, smart cities initiatives are rarely focused at the citizen-scale, nor do they necessarily attend to the ways initiatives can be user-led or co-designed. Drawing on the outcomes of a university studio, this article rethinks the smart city as a series of urban scales—metropolis, community, individual, and personal—and proposes an analytical model for classifying smart city initiatives in terms of engagement. Informed by the theory of proxemics, the model proposed analyses smart city initiatives in terms of the scope of their features and audience size; the actors accountable for their deployment and maintenance; their spatial reach; and the ability of design solutions to re-shape and adapt to different urban scenarios and precincts.

Although the experimental group outperformed the control group in overall case report evaluations, the connections between identified problems and proposed plans were weaker and nursing interventions tended to be less individualized for the experimental group. Conclusions The incorporation of AI tools such as ChatGPT and Copilot into a scaffolding teaching framework significantly boosted students' AI literacy and performance in summative assessments. Effective AI training for students, supervised use of these tools, and continuous professional development for educators are paramount to successful implementation. Addressing the current limitations of AI has the potential to further improve academic writing, foster critical thinking, and ensure responsible application in patient care, ultimately leading to higher-quality and more effective nursing education.",,"Artificial intelligence literacy, Nursing education, ChatGPT, Copilot, Academic report writing, Scaffolding teaching, Artificial intelligence"

These are protein complexes that form through noncovalent interactions between adhesion receptors in the cell membrane and similar receptors in neighboring cells or ligand molecules in the surrounding extracellular matrix. Cell adhesions are crucial to maintain tissue integrity and cellular communication. Communication and sensing occur through the transmittal of forces through adhesions. This relevant role motivated researchers to develop theoretical models of adhesion. Initial models were based on studies of association kinetics of proteins, which later were expanded to explicitly include the role of force in determining bond strength. The introduction of techniques that allowed measurements of force in the range of a single adhesion produced models that describe the inner workings of the adhesion molecules themselves. Despite the relative simplicity of these models, they are still relevant. Not only were these studies novel and creative, they have been integrated into models describing larger cellular aggregates, unraveling the role of mechanics in biology. These models have been used in the study of cell migration, developmental biology, and cancer biology.",Elsevier,"Adherens junction, Adhesion dynamics, Bond lifetime, Cell adhesion, Cellularized material, Focal adhesion, Force spectroscopy, Mathematical modeling, Mechanotransduction, Multiscale modeling, Rate constant, Vertex model"

Computational physics allows to simulate complex neural processes giving a chance to answer not only the original psychophysical questions but also to create models of the mind. In this paper several approaches relevant to modeling of the mind are outlined. Since direct modeling of the brain functions is rather limited due to the complexity of such models a number of approximations is introduced. The path from the brain, or computational neurosciences, to the mind, or cognitive sciences, is sketched, with emphasis on higher cognitive functions such as memory and consciousness. No fundamental problems in understanding of the mind seem to arise. From a computational point of view realistic models require massively parallel architectures.",,

We view the learner as a scientist who must divide her time between doing experiments and deducing predictions from promising theories, and we wish to know how she can do so most effectively. We explore several approaches based on the cost of making a prediction relative to the cost of performing an experiment. The resulting strategies share many qualitative characteristics with ""real"" science. This model is significant for the following reasons: •It allows us to study how a scientist might go about acquiring knowledge in a world where (as in real life) both performing experiments and making predictions from theories require time and effort.•It lays the foundation for a rigorous machine-implementable notion of ""subjective probability."" Good (1959, , 443-447) argues persuasively that subjective probability is at the heart of probability theory. Previous treatments of subjective probability do not handle the complication that the learner′s subjective probabilities may change as the result of pure thinking; our model captures this and other effects in a realistic manner. In addition, we begin to answer the question of how to trade off versus -a question that is fundamental for computers that must exist in the world and learn from their experience.",,

Actual solutions to real-life problems are scarce. What characterizes the adoption of big data problems to solutions and to what extent is there a match between them? OBJECTIVE We aim to assess the conditions of the adoption of big data technologies in agricultural applications, based on the investigation of twelve real-life practical use cases in the precision agriculture and livestock domain. METHODS We use a mixed method approach: a case study research around the twelve use cases of Horizon 2020 project CYBELE, varying from precision arable and livestock farming to fishing and food security, and a stakeholder survey (n = 56). Our analysis focuses on four perspectives: (1) the drivers of change that initiated the use cases; (2) the big data characteristics of the problem; (3) the technological maturity level of the solution both at start and end of the project; (4) the stakeholder perspective. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS Results show that the use cases’ drivers of change are a combination of data-, technology, research- and commercial interests; most have at least a research drive. The big data characteristics (volume, velocity, variety, veracity) are well-represented, with most emphasis on velocity and variety. Technology readiness levels show that the majority of use cases started at experimental or lab environment stage and aims at a technical maturity of real-world small-scale deployment. Stakeholders’ main concern is cost, user friendliness and to embed the solution within their current work practice. The adoption of better-matching big data solutions is modest. Big data solutions do not work out-of-the-box when changing application domains. Additional technology development is needed for addressing the idiosyncrasies of agricultural applications. SIGNIFICANCE We add a practical, empirical assessment of the current status of big data problems and solutions to the existing body of mainly theoretical knowledge. We considered the CYBELE research project as our laboratory for this. Our strength is that we interviewed the use case representatives in person, and that we included the stakeholders’ perspective in our results. Large-scale deployments need effective interdisciplinary approaches and long-term project horizons to address issues emerging from big data characteristics, and to avoid compartmentalization of agricultural sciences. We need both an engineering perspective – to make things work in practice – and a systems thinking perspective – to offer holistic, integrated solutions.",,"Big data solutions, Precision Agriculture, Case study, Stakeholders, Technological maturity level, Mixed-method approach"

A Gibbs–Duhem-type thermodynamic formalism is introduced to treat heterogeneous pressure within the phenomenological model, in agreement with Young–Laplace equation. Computer simulations are performed to study the effects of capillary forces (interfacial tension and Laplace pressure) on particle self-assembly at fluid interfaces in various two-dimensional cases. For isolated particles, it is found that the equilibrium liquid interface remains circular and particles of different shapes do not disturb the homogeneous curvature of liquid interface, while the equilibrium position, orientation and stability of a particle at the liquid interface depend on its shape and initial location with respect to the liquid interface. For interacting particles, the curvature of local liquid interfaces is different from the apparent curvature of the particle shell; nevertheless, irrespective of the particle shapes, a particle-coated droplet always tends to deform into a circular morphology under positive Laplace pressure, loses mechanical stability and collapses under negative Laplace pressure, while adapts to any morphology and stays in neutral equilibrium under zero Laplace pressure. Finally, the collective behaviors of particles and Laplace pressure evolution in bicontinuous interfacially jammed emulsion gels (bijels) are investigated.",,"Capillary forces, Surface tension, Laplace pressure, Diffuse interface field approach, Gibbs–Duhem relation, Shape anisotropy, Pickering emulsions"

The paper is framed in a theoretical approach, viewing students’ participation in scientific practices, and the development of higher-order thinking as necessary goals of science education. We argue that the focus on competencies, characterized as the ability to apply knowledge and skills in new contexts, involves a major change towards knowledge transfer and higher-order thinking skills. Some issues emerging from the analysis relate to the implications of assessment criteria and the challenges involved in its implementation, to the trends in teacher professional development and the difficulties related to the current economic crisis and to the results of the diagnostic evaluation and time frame needed for reforms to have an impact.

However, the development of competencies and literacy in handling digital technology has not kept pace, resulting in a significant disparity among individuals. Existing measurements of digital literacy were developed before widespread information and communications technology device adoption, mainly focusing on one’s perceptions of their proficiency and the utility of device operation. In the contemporary landscape, digital transformation is evolving within specialized domains, necessitating a comprehensive evaluation of digital competencies, attitudes, and proficiency in technology application to bridge the digital divide and ensure digital compliance. Objective This study was designed to address the shortcomings of existing scales and formulate a digital sensitivity scale tailored to the requirements of today’s society. Methods Initial items of the Yongin Severance Digital Sensitivity Scale (YI-DSS) were collected through a literature review, and expert opinions were gathered to ensure content validity. An exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis included 986 adult participants evaluating 14 digital literacy items and 6 digital efficacy items. The Cronbach α confirmed internal consistency reliability, and 2-tailed t tests, ANOVAs, and post hoc tests analyzed demographic differences in digital literacy and efficacy. Results A robust 4-factor digital literacy solution was identified: digital application, digital communication, critical thinking, and digital ethics (Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin=0.891; Bartlett × 2=9829.713; P<.001; Cronbach α=0.782-0.947). A 2-factor solution defined digital efficacy: digital confidence and digital anxiety (Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin=0.735; Bartlett × 2=3282.217; P<.001; Cronbach α=0.787-0.912). Confirmatory factor analysis was conducted for each model (digital literacy model: χ271=676.0, comparative fit index=0.938, Tucker-Lewis index=0.921, standardized root mean square residual=0.73, and root mean square error of approximation=0.093; digital efficacy model: χ28=81.9, comparative fit index=0.977, Tucker-Lewis index=0.958, standardized root mean square residual=0.73, and root mean square error of approximation=0.097), which indicated a good fit. The YI-DSS also showed high correlation with the previously developed Digital Literacy Scale (r=0.809; P<.001). Conclusions The YI-DSS, as a self-assessment tool, has the potential to bridge the generational information gap by promoting acceptance, motivation, and adaptation to digital technology. Furthermore, given the remote nature of digital therapeutics, an individual’s familiarity with required technologies and digital communication strongly influences their acceptance of digital treatments and the efficacy thereof. This scale can play a pivotal role in enhancing compliance with digital therapeutics by preemptively assessing individuals’ technological literacy and competency.",,"information literacy, health literacy, computer literacy, self-efficacy, attitude, digital divide"

The same neurotransmitters are also responsible for inter-individual differences in temperamental traits. Here we explored whether biologically defined temperamental traits determine differences in the ability to orient spatial attention as a function of the probabilistic association between cues and targets. To this aim, we administered the Structure of Temperament Questionnaire (STQ-77) to a sample of 151 participants who also performed a Posner task with central endogenous predictive (80 % valid/20 % invalid) or non-predictive cues (50 % valid/50 % invalid). We found that only participants with high scores in Plasticity and Intellectual Endurance showed a selective abatement of attentional costs with non-predictive cues. In addition, stepwise regression showed that costs in the non-predictive condition were negatively predicted by scores in Plasticity and positively predicted by scores in Probabilistic Thinking. These results show that stable temperamental characteristics play an important role in defining the inter-individual differences in attentional behaviour, especially in the presence of different probabilistic organisations of the sensory environment. These findings emphasize the importance of considering temperamental and personality traits in social and professional environments where the ability to control one's attention is a crucial functional skill.",,"Attention, Temperament, Personality, Posner task, Neurotransmitters"

Here, we present computational evidence that indicates that adult neurogenesis may make three separate but related contributions to memory formation. First, immature neurons introduce a degree of similarity to memories learned at the same time, a process we refer to as pattern integration. Second, the extended maturation and change in excitability of these neurons make this added similarity a time-dependent effect, supporting the possibility that temporal information is included in new hippocampal memories. Finally, our model suggests that the experience-dependent addition of neurons results in a dentate gyrus network well suited for encoding new memories in familiar contexts while treating novel contexts differently.

Subjects' naming latencies were slowed by 30ms for each preceding member of the category. This effect was both cumulative and linear, and unrelated to the lag elapsing since the previous presentation of a category member. These results definitively demonstrate the occurrence of cumulative interference for word retrieval by prior retrieval of other exemplars of the same semantic category—cumulative semantic inhibition.

We provide computational-modelling evidence in support of this claim. We show that no current theory of spoken word production has all of these properties.

The revelation principle fails for level-k models, so restricting attention to direct mechanisms and imposing incentive-compatibility are not without loss of generality. If, however, only direct, level-k-incentive-compatible mechanisms are feasible and traders' levels are observable, Myerson and Satterthwaite's characterization of mechanisms that maximize traders' total surplus subject to incentive constraints generalizes qualitatively to level-k models. If only direct, level-k-incentive-compatible mechanisms are feasible but traders' levels are not observable, generically a particular posted-price mechanism maximizes traders' total expected surplus subject to incentive constraints.

Given their role and subject matter expertise (SME), nurses are also essential for the design and development of a supervised machine learning (ML) model for pain detection and clinical decision support software (CDSS) in a pain recognition automated monitoring system (PRAMS). Our first step for developing PRAMS with nurses was to create SME-friendly data labeling software. Purpose To develop an intuitive and efficient data labeling software solution, Human-to-Artificial Intelligence (H2AI). Method The Human-centered Design for Embedded Machine Learning Solutions (HCDe-MLS) model was used to engage nurses. In this paper, HCDe-MLS will be explained using H2AI and PRAMS as illustrative cases. Findings Using HCDe-MLS, H2AI was developed and facilitated labeling of 139 videos (mean = 29.83 min) with 3189 images labeled (mean = 75 s) by 6 nurses. OpenCV was used for video-to-image pre-processing; and MobileFaceNet was used for default landmark placement on images. H2AI randomly assigned videos to nurses for data labeling, tracked labelers’ inter-rater reliability, and stored labeled data to train ML models.

A novel approach towards cutting pattern generation is the so-called Variation of Reference Strategy (VaReS) [1], which minimizes the total potential energy arising from the motion of a planar cutting pattern to its corresponding three-dimensional shape. With non-uniform rational B-Splines (NURBS) being the standard tool for geometry description in CAD, it is only consequent to use these for analysis as well. Isogeometric B-Rep Analysis (IBRA) [2] follows up on this idea and enriches the original Isogeometric Analysis (IGA), which was introduced by Hughes et al. [3], by the possibility of analysing trimmed NURBS geometries. This paper presents cutting pattern generation with the Variation of Reference Strategy in the context of IGA/IBRA. With this approach, the whole design of a membrane structure can be represented by NURBS geometries – including blueprint plans. To use the benefits of IBRA for cutting pattern generation, a NURBS-based membrane-element was developed for the VaReS routine. A developable surface serves as a benchmark example, since its analytical cutting pattern is known.

Sublexical, lexical, and multi-word knowledge were charted across development (Study 1), showing that while input quantity may be important early in learning, lexical diversity is ultimately more crucial, a prediction confirmed against children’s data (Study 2). The model trained on a lexically diverse input also performed better on nonword repetition and sentence recall tests (Study 3) and was quicker to learn new words over time (Study 4).

However, materials research often involves long timelines and low success probabilities, dissuading investors who have expectations of shorter times from bench to business. A combination of emergent technologies could accelerate the pace of novel materials development by ten times or more, aligning the timelines of stakeholders (investors and researchers), markets, and the environment, while increasing return on investment. First, tool automation enables rapid experimental testing of candidate materials. Second, high-performance computing concentrates experimental bandwidth on promising compounds by predicting and inferring bulk, interface, and defect-related properties. Third, machine learning connects the former two, where experimental outputs automatically refine theory and help define next experiments. We describe state-of-the-art attempts to realize this vision and identify resource gaps. We posit that over the coming decade, this combination of tools will transform the way we perform materials research, with considerable first-mover advantages at stake.",,"accelerated materials development, machine learning, artificial intelligence, energy materials"

First, we provide a methodological pathway from theories of situated, embodied cognition to simulations with an eye to empirical evidence, and suggest a possible cross-fertilization between cognitive robotics and psychology. Psychological theories, in particular those formulated at an abstract level, include models which are often severely underspecified at the level of mechanisms. This is true in the synchronic, constructive perspective (how can the effects observed in experiments be concretely generated by the model's mechanisms?) and in the diachronic, developmental perspective (how can such mechanisms be learned and developed?). The synthetic method of artificial cognitive systems research, and in particular of cognitive robotics, can complement research in psychology (and neurosciences) by exploring the constructive and developmental aspects of theories. Our second aim is to provide an example of such a methodology by describing simulations aiming at developing a perceptual symbol system (PSS) (Barsalou, 1999). We then describe the two main theoretical constructs of the PSS, perceptual symbols and simulators, illustrate their development in an artificial system, and test the system in prediction, categorization, and abstraction tasks.",,"Perceptual symbol systems, Schemas, Embodiment, Anticipation, Simulation"

The critical issue is whether choices arising from subjects with lower cognitive abilities are more likely driven by errors or lack of understanding than pure preferences for risk. The latter implies that the often-argued link between risk preferences and cognitive abilities (a common finding is that abilities relate negatively to risk aversion and positively to loss aversion) might be a spurious correlation. This experiment reports evidence from a sample of 556 participants who made choices in two risk-related tasks and completed three cognitive tasks, all with real monetary incentives: number-additions (including incentive-compatible expected number of correct additions), the Cognitive Reflection Test (to measure analytical/reflective thinking) and the Remote Associates Test (for convergent thinking). Results are unambiguous: none of our cognition measures plays any systematic role on risky decision making. Using structural equation modeling and factor analysis, we show that cognitive abilities are negatively associated with noisy, inconsistent choices and this effect may make higher ability individuals appear to be less risk averse and more loss averse. Yet we show that errors are more likely to appear when the two payoffs in a given decision exhibit similar probability. Therefore, our results suggest that failing to account for noisy decision making might have led to erroneously inferring a correlation between cognitive abilities and risk preferences in previous studies.",,"Decision making under uncertainty, Cognitive abilities, Online experiment, Risk and loss aversion, Factor analysis"

Despite all this work, tracing the core dynamics of metaphors over time remains a persistent challenge. To address this problem, I propose a systematic analysis of metaphor anchored around four core questions. What do metaphors describe? How do metaphors change over time? What do metaphors do? And how do conventional metaphors emerge? I address these questions in the context of one persistent and prolific metaphor: the network metaphor. To do so, I offer a formal model of the career of metaphor by drawing on cognitive linguistics and sociological theories of public ideas and professional careers. Specifically, I integrate the Google Books Ngram corpus with computational techniques that leverage co-occurrence to visualize and interpret the career of the network metaphor with respect to four areas: its jurisdiction, temporality, ecology, and conventionality. I leverage the network metaphor as both a revelatory case for evaluating my model and a critical case for deepening our historical understanding of the network. My analysis lends validation to the argument that the network metaphor has achieved the status of a broad category for thinking about contemporary life. However, it also demonstrates that the network metaphor had a lively history prior to the twentieth century. This includes significant changes in how it was used in the first half of the nineteenth century, a career standing in for anatomical structures of the body in the mid-nineteenth century, and a predominant expression in simile form prior to the start of the twentieth century.",,"Metaphor, Network, Formal model, Computational hermeneutics, Text analysis"

The literature shows that the absence of effective methods to facilitate shared decision-making can result in poor patient engagement and unfavorable decision outcomes. Objective In this paper, we propose a Collaborative Decision Description Language (CoDeL) to model shared decision-making between patients and physicians, offering a theoretical foundation for studying various shared decision scenarios. Methods CoDeL is based on an extension of the interaction protocol language of Lightweight Social Calculus. The language utilizes speech acts to represent the attitudes of shared decision-makers toward decision propositions, as well as their semantic relationships within dialogues. It supports interactive argumentation among decision makers by embedding clinical evidence into each segment of decision protocols. Furthermore, CoDeL enables personalized decision-making, allowing for the demonstration of characteristics such as persistence, critical thinking, and openness. Results The feasibility of the approach is demonstrated through a case study of shared decision-making in the disease domain of atrial fibrillation. Our experimental results show that integrating the proposed language with GPT can further enhance its capabilities in interactive decision-making, improving interpretability. Conclusions The proposed novel CoDeL can enhance doctor-patient shared decision-making in a rational, personalized, and interpretable manner.",,"shared decision-making, speech acts, agent, argumentation, interaction protocol"

A new reality is that we are awash in data and tools to analyze these data and one of the most significant challenges is that of enabling the researcher to discover datasets relevant to their work, collect these data, assess its quality, and analyze it. The development of an adequate infrastructure within a researcher’s institution greatly facilitates progress on this front, both in terms of the development of tools and the development of local informatics expertise necessary to complement the domain-specific expertise of the researcher. As an informatics community we often ponder the heterogeneity of tools and resources on a global scale at the expense of the more immediate local problems encountered on a routine basis. Here, we suggest that getting our own houses in order by first employing interoperable solutions that support and facilitate collaboration amongst the complementary disciplines within our own institutions places the informatics community in a better position to address global informatics challenges. This approach can ensure that the solutions implemented employ an architecture and standards that support interoperability. Indeed, this is an organizational and cultural challenge rather than a technological one. Organizational structure and practices are described that provide a comprehensive base of talent capable of creating an environment that supports a sustainable informatics infrastructure, and that can quickly grow as needed to support the specific and rapidly evolving needs unique to that institution.",Elsevier,

The IDSM will integrate multi-criteria decision making via intelligent technologies like expert systems, fuzzy logic, machine learning and genetic algorithms. Cognitive technology is currently simulated in safety–critical systems to highlight variables of interest, interface with intelligent technologies, and provide an environment that improves a system’s cognitive performance. In this study, the IDSM is being applied to an actual safety–critical system, an unmanned surface vehicle (USV) with embedded artificial intelligence (AI) software. The USV’s safety performance is being researched in a simulated and a real world nautical based environment. The objective is to build a dynamically changing model to evaluate a cognitive architecture’s ability to ensure safe performance of an intelligent safety–critical system. The IDSM does this by finding a set of key safety performance parameters that can be critiqued via safety measurements, mechanisms and methodologies. The uniqueness of this research will be on bounding the decision making associated with the cognitive architecture’s key safety parameters (KSP).

Despite this growing interest, research specifically addressing the Thai context has remained scarce. Thus, this quantitative study aimed to bridge this gap by assessing the proficiency of Thai Gen Z accountants in detecting accounting fraud, with a particular emphasis on their digital, data science, and diagnostic skills. The study collected data from 150 participants using a structured survey questionnaire distributed to licensed accountants affiliated with the Thailand accounting program. It adopted a theoretical framework inspired by social learning theory and information processing theory to examine both direct and mediated relationships among the key variables under investigation. The results were analyzed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) to examine these relationships. The results showed that digital competency have significant direct effects on the fraud detection skills, with diagnostic skills playing a key role in the process. The study revealed that digital competency not only furnishes accountants with necessary technological expertise but also bolsters their analytical skills, which are vital for identifying fraudulent activities. Likewise, data science literacy—encompassing skills in predictive analytics, big data management, and data insight communication—significantly enhances accountants' capacity to identify and understand fraudulent patterns.

Verbal thinking is associated with the formation of a structural–functional organization of a pattern-code of verbal signals. Nonverbal thinking is associated with comprehension of the principles that make up the structural organization of environment. This type of thinking occurs in humans and other vertebrates. The chapter also discusses physiological and phenotypic aspects of nonverbal thinking. Both types of thinking have their own characteristics, which are related to the chemistry of the brain, and both reflect the nature of man. The main characteristic of nonverbal thinking is the success in performing the task at the first attempt. Repeated presentations of the task often lead to refusals to resolve it, the appearance of fear of the experimental conditions, and numerous signs of an overexcited state. A study described in the chapter revealed age to be a leading factor in determining the accurate understanding of object movement within the spatial–temporal coordinate system when the exact whereabouts of the object is unknown.",Pergamon,

For achieving our goal, items based on the PISA frameworks are developed, students in grades 5–8 from three different Russian regions are assessed, and three IRT models (unidimensional, multidimensional, and bifactor) are applied to process the data. In addition, the correlations from the multidimensional model are estimated to examine the degree of cognitive specificity and mixture modeling is implemented to investigate ability differentiation across grades. Statistical analysis reveals that the bifactor model comprising one general and six specific factors, has a better fit in each grade. Based on this model, we compute the variance explained by the general factor, with the estimates varying between 60% and 70%. In general, the pure variance explained by specific factors does not exceed 10%.

The internal representation is distributed throughout the brain in two forms: (1) firmware embedded in synaptic connections and axon-dendrite circuitry, and (2) dynamic state-variables encoded in the firing rates of neurons in computational loops in the spinal cord, midbrain, subcortical nuclei, and arrays of cortical columns. It assumes that clusters and arrays of neurons are capable of computing logical predicates, smooth arithmetic functions, and matrix transformations over a space defined by large input vectors and arrays. Feedback from output to input of these neural computational units enable them to function as finite-state-automata (fsa), Markov decision processes (MDP), or delay lines in processing signals and generating strings and grammars. Thus, clusters of neurons are capable of parsing and generating language, decomposing tasks, generating plans, and executing scripts. In the cortex, neurons are arranged in arrays of cortical columns that interact in tight loops with their underlying subcortical nuclei. It is hypothesized that these circuits compute sophisticated mathematical and logical functions that maintain and use complex abstract data structures. It is proposed that cortical hypercolumns together with their underlying thalamic nuclei can be modeled as a cortical computational unit (CCU) consisting of a frame-like data structure (containing attributes and pointers) plus the computational processes and mechanisms required to maintain it and use it for perception cognition, and sensory-motor behavior. In sensory processing areas of the brain, CCU processes enable focus of attention, segmentation, grouping, and classification. Pointers stored in CCU frames define relationships that link pixels and signals to objects and events in situations and episodes. CCU frame pointers also link objects and events to class prototypes and overlay them with meaning and emotional values. In behavior generating areas of the brain, CCU processes make decisions, set goals and priorities, generate plans, and control behavior. In general, CCU pointers are used to define rules, grammars, procedures, plans, and behaviors. CCU pointers also define abstract data structures analogous to lists, frames, objects, classes, rules, plans, and semantic nets. It is suggested that it may be possible to reverse engineer the human brain at the CCU level of fidelity using next-generation massively parallel computer hardware and software.",,"Brain modeling, Cognitive modeling, Human neocortex, Image processing, Knowledge representation, Perception, Reverse engineering the brain, Segmentation, Signals to symbols"

Photos do not need to be false (altered or generated) to mislead; real photos can create a slanted representation or be repurposed from different events. Even semantically related non-probative photos, merely inserted to attract eyeballs, can increase message acceptance through increased fluency. Messages with images receive more attention and reach a wider audience. Text-congruent images can scaffold the comprehension of true and false claims and support the formation of correct and false memories. Standard laboratory procedures may underestimate the impact of images in natural media contexts: by drawing all participants' attention to a message that may be ignored without an image, they inflate message effects in the control condition. Misleading images are difficult to identify and their influence often remains outside of awareness, making it hard to curb their influence through critical-thinking interventions. Current concerns about deep fakes may reduce trust in all images, potentially limiting their power to mislead as well as inform.

Granular computing has emerged as an important conceptual and computational paradigm of information processing. As an emerging field of study, it has been suggested that granular computing at philosophical level concerns with structural thinking and at the application level concerns with structured problem solving. It has been further suggested that fuzzy information granulation, as a special case of granular computing, is likely to play an important role in the evolution of fuzzy logic and may eventually have a far-reaching impact on its applications. Responding to the calls for future studies dealing with the applications of fuzzy information granulation, this paper presents an application of the theory of fuzzy information granulation in an emerging and important area where there has not yet been any application, showing how online sports services can make sense of huge amount of data in a structured way and how they can structure their decisions. The empirical results show that despite the huge amount of data that needs to be processed, fuzzy information granulation can help online sports services make sense of it and identify meaningful granules for easier decision making.",,"Information granulation, Fuzzy granulation, Application, Online business"

Here we expand this assumption by showing that an extremely open-ended, high-level cognitive task of thinking about an abstract content, loosely defined as “abstract thinking” - leads to highly consistent activation maps. Specifically, we show that activation maps generated during such cognitive process were precisely located relative to borders of well-known networks such as internal speech, visual and motor imagery. The activation patterns allowed decoding the thought condition at >95%. Surprisingly, the activated networks remained the same regardless of changes in thought content. Finally, we found remarkably consistent activation maps across individuals engaged in abstract thinking. This activation bordered, but strictly avoided visual and motor networks. On the other hand, it overlapped with left lateralized language networks. Activation of the default mode network (DMN) during abstract thought was similar to DMN activation during rest. These observations were supported by a quantitative neuronal distance metric analysis. Our results reveal that despite its high level, and varied content nature - abstract thinking activates surprisingly precise and consistent networks in participants’ brains.",,"Abstract-thoughts, Visual imagery, Default mode network, Language, fMRI"

We find that optimism and overconfidence are positively correlated at the individual level and that both help to explain wishful thinking. These findings suggest that ignoring optimism results in an upwardly biased estimate of the role of overconfidence in explaining wishful thinking. To illustrate this point, we show that 30% of our observations are misclassified as under- or overconfident if optimism is omitted from the analysis.

GA is also used when individuals with autism (ASD) and Williams syndrome (WS) are thinking during question-answer interactions. We investigated GA strategies during face-to-face social style interactions with familiar and unfamiliar interlocutors. Participants with WS and ASD used overall typical amounts/patterns of GA with all participants looking away most while thinking and remembering (in contrast to listening and speaking). However there were a couple of specific disorder related differences: participants with WS looked away less when thinking and interacting with unfamiliar interlocutors; in typical development and WS familiarity was associated with reduced gaze aversion, however no such difference was evident in ASD. Results inform typical/atypical social and cognitive phenotypes. We conclude that gaze aversion serves some common functions in typical and atypical development in terms of managing the cognitive and social load of interactions. There are some specific idiosyncracies associated with managing familiarity in ASD and WS with elevated sociability with unfamiliar others in WS and a lack of differentiation to interlocutor familiarity in ASD. Regardless of the familiarity of the interlocutor, GA is associated with thinking for typically developing as well as atypically developing groups.

(i) Correlation: a neural representation correlates to its represented content; (ii) causal role: the representation has a characteristic effect on behavior; and (iii) teleology: a goal or purpose served by the behavior and thus the representation. We draw broadly on literature in both neuroscience and philosophy to show how these three aspects are rooted in common approaches to understanding the brain and mind.

Policy and public discourse around digitalisation embrace and adhere to the narrow tenets enlightenment thinking; the idea that rationality, individual freedom, and a society free from superstition are necessary and attainable goals. The costs of what has come to be called ‘Modernity’ are many. Through the application of rationality to all spheres of life, married with disruptive technological advancement, humanity has diminished its’ imagination – its ability to seek new directions. To paraphrase Horkheimer and Adorno, Modernism fights against nature, of which we are a part, and thus, paradoxically, sets us in a fight against ourselves. Environmental degradation, the price of progress, being just one example of this – deadening work, consumerism and severed social connections being amongst others. In this framing, digitalisation itself comes to be understood itself as akin to a force of nature – one that we can do little about, other than adjust and adapt or be swept away. But this by no means a foregone conclusion, there is light at the end of the optical fibre. Albeit that recent technical developments around artificial intelligence appears to be pushing policy makers into hasty decisions, the pace of the technical development is not as fast as we believe, and in comparison with the Reformation – we have time. If we can restrain ourselves from the resist, adapt or die responses promoted in popular discourse in face of the shock of large language models and rising threat of automation, then we create room to consider economic, social, and ecological alignment and accord, in the decision making and design of future interactive artefacts and digital services. The article argues that through postdigital aesthetics, technology makers can embrace materiality and the inherent qualities of digital technology to formulate a critique of existing trajectories in digital transformation, with consequences for a more sustainable future.",,"Dialectics, Digital transformation, Digitalisation, Postdigital"

The reformulated algorithm has been used to implement REST (Ripple Effect and Stability Tool) which produces ripple effect measures for C programs. This paper describes the reformulation of Yau and Collofello’s ripple effect algorithm focusing on the computation of matrix Zm which holds intramodule change propagation information. The reformulation of the ripple effect algorithm is validated using fifteen programs which have been grouped by type. Due to the approximation spurious 1s are contained within matrix Zm.

DIM consists in categories of mental operations foundational for learning that contain inborn components called inner operations, which are self-developing in the interaction mind-environment. Within the DIM paradigm, the input cognitive systems are not domain specific or core-knowledge specific, they are operational specific and capable of further developments that become domain specific while experiencing the environment. Arguments for this construal come from three sources: literature review, data collected through classroom observations, and a four-year experimental study of teaching and learning mathematics in primary grades.

The veracity of such prospective action judgements, and the mechanisms by which they are computed, was explored in a series of tasks that involved either grasping (MC conditions) or thinking about grasping (PJ conditions) a dowel presented in various orientations. PJs concerning limits of comfortable hand supination and pronation when turning a dowel in the picture plane were highly consistent with values obtained during actual hand rotation (Exp. 1). The same was true for judgements regarding the level of awkwardness involved in adopting a prescribed grip (e.g. overhand with right hand) for dowels in various picture plane orientations (Exp. 2). When allowed to select the most natural grip (overhand versus underhand) or hand (left versus right) for engaging dowels in these orientations, subjects preferred virtually identical responses in both PJ and MC conditions. In both instances, they consistently chose the least awkward response options. As would be expected for actual movements, PJs involving awkward hand postures had longer response times (RTs), and were less accurate. Likewise, latencies for both grip and hand judgements tended to increase as a function of the angular distance between the current positions of subjects’ hands, and the orientation of the chosen posture. Together, these findings are consistent with a the hypothesis that PJs involve mentally simulated actions, or motor imagery. These results suggest that motor imagery does not depend on the existence of a completed premotor plan (Jeannerod, 1994), but may instead be involved in the planning process itself. A provisional model for the involvement of imagery in motor planning is outlined, as are a set of criteria for evaluating claims of the involvement of motor imagery in problem solving.",,"Motor imagery, Prospective judgements, Prehension"

We propose to conduct global variance-based sensitivity analysis instead, whereby n parameters are viewed as uncertain at once and their importance is assessed jointly. Our method works by encoding the uncertainties as n additional variables of the network. To prevent the curse of dimensionality while adding these dimensions, we use low-rank tensor decomposition to break down the new potentials into smaller factors. Last, we apply the method of Sobol to the resulting network to obtain n global sensitivity indices, one for each parameter of interest. Using a benchmark array of both expert-elicited and learned Bayesian networks, we demonstrate that the Sobol indices can significantly differ from the OAT indices, thus revealing the true influence of uncertain parameters and their interactions.",,"Bayesian networks, Sensitivity analysis, Sobol indices, Tensor networks, Uncertainty quantification"

However, these trials may not accurately reflect the real-world experiences of more diverse and heterogeneous patient populations, who often have higher disease burden and more comorbidities. Therefore, postmarketing safety surveillance is warranted. Regulatory organizations encourage marketing authorization holders to screen digital media for suspected adverse reactions, applying the same requirements as for spontaneous reports. Real-world data from social media platforms constitute a potential venue to capture diverse patient experiences and help detect treatment-related adverse events. However, while social media holds promise for this purpose, its use in pharmacovigilance is still in its early stages. Computational linguistics, which involves the automatic manipulation and quantitative analysis of oral or written language, offers a potential method for exploring this content. Objective This study aims to characterize adverse events related to monoclonal antibodies targeting CGRP signaling on Reddit, a large online social media forum, by using computational linguistics. Methods We examined differences in word frequencies from medication-related posts on the Reddit subforum r/Migraine over a 10-year period (2010-2020) using computational linguistics. The study had 2 phases: a validation phase and an application phase. In the validation phase, we compared posts about propranolol and topiramate, as well as posts about each medication against randomly selected posts, to identify known and expected adverse events. In the application phase, we analyzed posts discussing 2 monoclonal antibodies targeting CGRP signaling—erenumab and fremanezumab—to identify potential adverse events for these medications. Results From 22,467 Reddit r/Migraine posts, we extracted 402 (2%) propranolol posts, 1423 (6.33%) topiramate posts, 468 (2.08%) erenumab posts, and 73 (0.32%) fremanezumab posts. Comparing topiramate against propranolol identified several expected adverse events, for example, “appetite,” “weight,” “taste,” “foggy,” “forgetful,” and “dizziness.” Comparing erenumab against a random selection of terms identified “constipation” as a recurring keyword. Comparing erenumab against fremanezumab identified “constipation,” “depression,” “vomiting,” and “muscle” as keywords. No adverse events were identified for fremanezumab. Conclusions The validation phase of our study accurately identified common adverse events for oral migraine preventive medications. For example, typical adverse events such as “appetite” and “dizziness” were mentioned in posts about topiramate. When we applied this methodology to monoclonal antibodies targeting CGRP or its receptor—fremanezumab and erenumab, respectively—we found no definite adverse events for fremanezumab. However, notable flagged words for erenumab included “constipation,” “depression,” and “vomiting.” In conclusion, computational linguistics applied to social media may help identify potential adverse events for novel therapeutics.

Forests have historically not been perceived as interconnected networks of trees; recently however, researchers have described the “wood-wide web” in which underground fungi interconnect large numbers of trees and plants via chemical and electrical signals. Some of earth’s forests number many billions of trees, and some of the world’s prairies and seagrass meadows also contain billions of individual plants. These plant ecosystems may thus be self-aware, and in fact there may be a multitude of self-aware plant-based ecosystems on earth already. The speed of signal transmission via fungi within each ecosystem is much slower than that in humans, and therefore their organismal self-awareness may be of a different nature than the self-awareness that we associate with humans and upper primates.

KCaBi, as a high-throughput screening semiconductor with ultralow κl [J. Am. Chem. Soc. 144, 4448 (2022)], has been demonstrated that the contribution of optical phonons plays an important role in thermal transport. In this work, by solving the Boltzmann transport equation, it is found that the κl of KCaBi is 2.2 at 300K, with acoustic phonons dominating the z-direction κl and optical phonons contributing around 50% to the x-direction κl under the four-phonon picture. The uncommon contribution of optical phonons also manifests the possibility of tuning the κl anisotropy based on optical phonons. Following this line of thinking, it is found that applying tensile strain can cause a more pronounced decrease of acoustic phonon contribution than that of optical counterpart due to the highly dispersive optical branches, thus enhancing the anisotropic ratio of κl. Moreover, the microscopic mechanism is elucidated by analyzing the phonon dispersion relation, phonon mode-wise contribution and phonon scattering rates.

This cross-case analysis study examined the supports that two students with disabilities, who were initially disengaged during computing activities, received during computing instruction. Data revealed that students' support needs during computing activities were not CT-specific. Rather, supports specific to these students' needs that were successful in other educational areas were also successful and sufficient in CT. Although additional studies would need to be conducted to ascertain the transferability of these findings to other contexts and students, our results contribute evidence that students with disabilities can and should participate in CT and be provided with the supports they need, just as in all other areas of the curriculum. We present a framework for evaluating student engagement to identify student-specific supports and, when needed, refine the emerging K-12 CT pedagogy to facilitate full participation of all students.

However, aneurysms of the circle of Willis frequently involve locations with more than one source of inflow, such as aneurysms of the anterior communicating artery. The highest resolution images of cerebral vessels are from RA images, but this technique is limited to visualizing only one route of inflow at a time, leaving a significant limitation in the application of 3DRA image sets for clinical studies of patient-specific computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. In this report, subject-specific models of cerebral aneurysms with multiple avenues of flow are constructed from RA images by using a novel combination of image coregistration and surface merging techniques. Materials and Methods RA images are obtained by means of contrast injection in each vessel that provides inflow to the aneurysm. Anatomic models are constructed independently of each of these vascular trees and fused together into a single model. The model is used to construct a finite element grid for CFD simulations of hemodynamics. Results Three examples of patient-specific models are presented: an anterior communicating artery aneurysm, a basilar tip aneurysm, and a model of an entire circle of Willis with five coincident aneurysms. The method is evaluated with a numeric phantom of an aneurysm in the anterior communicating artery. Conclusion These examples show that this new technique can be used to create merged network numeric models for CFD modeling. Furthermore, intra-aneurysmal flow patterns are influenced strongly by merging of the two inflow streams. This effect decreases as distance from the merging streams increases.",,

Fast algorithms for predicting secondary structure are fundamental to this task. We describe a modified formulation of the Zuker-Stiegler algorithm with coaxial stacking, a stabilising interaction in which the ends of helices in multi-loops are stacked. In particular, optimal coaxial stacking is computed as part of the dynamic programming state, rather than in an inner loop. We introduce a new notion of sparsity, which we call replaceability. Replaceability is a more general condition and applicable in more places than the triangle inequality that is used by previous sparse folding methods. We also introduce non-monotonic candidate lists as an additional sparsification tool. Existing usages of the triangle inequality for sparsification can be thought of as an application of both replaceability and monotonicity together. The modified recurrences along with replaceability allows sparsification to be applied to coaxial stacking as well, which increases the speed of the algorithm. We implemented this algorithm in software we call memerna, which we show to have the fastest exact (non–heuristic) implementation of RNA folding under the complete Turner 2004 model with coaxial stacking, out of several popular RNA folding tools supporting coaxial stacking. We also introduce a new notation for secondary structure which includes coaxial stacking, terminal mismatches, and dangles (CTDs) information.

It is necessary to modify the operating point efficiently and accurately with the help of MPPT technology to maximize the collected power. Even though a lot of research has been carried out and impressive progress achieved for MPPT technology, it still faces some challenges and dilemmas. Firstly, the mathematical model established for PV cells is not precise enough. Second, the existing algorithms are often optimized for specific conditions and lack comprehensive adaptability to the actual operating environment. Besides, a single algorithm may not be able to give full play to its advantages. In the end, the selection criteria for choosing the suitable MPPT algorithm/converter combination to achieve better performance in a given scenario is very limited. Therefore, this paper systematically discusses the current research status and challenges faced by PV MPPT technology around the three aspects of MPPT models, algorithms, and hardware implementation.

Objective The aim of this study was to examine how people of different ages (1) experienced the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and (2) their respective rates and reasons for compliance or noncompliance with social distancing and isolation health guidance. Methods We fielded a survey on social media early in the pandemic to examine the emotional impact of COVID-19 and individuals’ rates and reasons for noncompliance with public health guidance, using computational and content analytic methods of linguistic analysis. Results A total of 17,287 participants were surveyed. The majority (n=13,183, 76.3%) were from the United States. Younger (18-31 years), middle-aged (32-44 years and 45-64 years), and older (≥65 years) individuals significantly varied in how they described the impact of COVID-19 on their lives, including their emotional experience, self-focused attention, and topical concerns. Younger individuals were more emotionally negative and self-focused, while middle-aged people were other-focused and concerned with family. The oldest and most at-risk group was most concerned with health-related terms but were lower in anxiety (use of fewer anxiety-related terms) and higher in the use of emotionally positive terms than the other less at-risk age groups. While all groups discussed topics such as acquiring essential supplies, they differentially experienced the impact of school closures and limited social interactions. We also found relatively high rates of noncompliance with COVID-19 prevention measures, such as social distancing and self-isolation, with younger people being more likely to be noncompliant than older people (P<.001). Among the 43.1% (n=7456) of respondents who did not fully comply with health orders, people differed substantially in the reasons they gave for noncompliance. The most common reason for noncompliance was not being able to afford to miss work (n=4273, 57.3%). While work obligations proved challenging for participants across ages, younger people struggled more to find adequate space to self-isolate and manage their mental and physical health; middle-aged people had more concerns regarding childcare; and older people perceived themselves as being able to take sufficient precautions. Conclusions Analysis of natural language can provide insight into rapidly developing public health challenges like the COVID-19 pandemic, uncovering individual differences in emotional experiences and health-related behaviors. In this case, our analyses revealed significant differences between different age groups in feelings about and responses to public health orders aimed to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. To improve public compliance with health orders as the pandemic continues, health communication strategies could be made more effective by being tailored to these age-related differences.",,"COVID-19, natural language processing, public health messaging, social distancing compliance, age differences, older adults, younger adults, age, NLP, public health, elderly, youth, adult, emotion, compliance, guideline"

We describe the sources of systemic complexity and highlight the role of risk assessments as a formal sense-making device that enables learning and organizing knowledge of the dynamic interplay between the climate-sensitive system and its (climatological) environment. We highlight boundary judgments as a core concern of risk assessments, helping to create islands of analytical and cognitive tractability in a complex, uncertain, and ambiguous world. We then point to three key concepts—boundary critique, multi-methodology, and second-order learning—as critical elements of contemporary risk assessment practice, and we weave these into an overarching framework to better account for systemic complexity in the assessment of climate risk.",,

According to the literature, social support can either refer to the social resources that individuals perceive to be available or to the support that is actually provided in problematic situations. The proposed model distinguishes between both roles of social support. The role of social network characteristics has been taken into account, as an individual can perceive or receive social support through his/her social network. In addition, the number of connections (friends), strength of ties (relationships), social isolation and social integration have been studied. Simulation experiments have been done to analyze the effect of the different types of support in different scenarios and also to analyze the role of various social network characteristics on the mood level. It is shown that support can help to reduce the induced stress and thus can contribute to healthy mood regulation and prevention of depression.

A multiscale probabilistic simulation-optimization framework is developed based on the nested nature of watersheds to inform decision robustness for Best Management Practices (BMPs). We presented a novel approach using hybrid Bayesian Networks (BNs) as interpretable and probabilistic emulators of process-based models. The hybrid BNs established at the scale of Hydrologic Response Units (HRUs) are embedded into simulation-optimization, whereby we analyze the cost-effectiveness-robustness of candidate BMP strategies at the subbasin scale. The optimal strategy is identified in compliance with water quality standards using watershed-scale integer programming. We apply the approaches in a typical intensively cultivated plateau watershed adjacent to Lake Dianchi, one of the three most eutrophic lakes in China. Our findings suggest that the hybrid BNs, incorporating both quantitative and qualitative information, are reliable emulators of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) in capturing critical pathways of diffuse phosphorus. Tradeoffs among cost, effectiveness, and robustness follow the law of diminishing marginal benefits. The optimum BMP strategies vary with policymakers’ preference toward robustness levels. Our findings indicate that robustness should be accounted for as an additional decision attribute besides costs and pollution mitigation. The benefits of the modeling framework are to (i) reduce over 99% computation complexity and support efficient decision-making under multifaceted uncertainties; (ii) improve interpretability and reliability of machine learning emulators; and (iii) inform policymakers of robustness with the probability of water quality restoration success.",,"Diffuse nutrient, BMPs, Machine learning, Uncertainty, Simulation-optimization, Bayesian network"

To develop the account, I argue that natural language is structured in a way that lets us formalize grammatical knowledge precisely in terms of rich primitives of interpretation. Primitives of interpretation can be correctly viewed intentionally, as explanations of our choices of linguistic actions; the model therefore fits our intuitions about meaning in conversation. Nevertheless, interpretations for complex utterances can be built from these primitives by simple operations of grammatical derivation. In bridging analyses of meaning at semantic and symbol-processing levels, this account underscores the fundamental place for computation in the cognitive science of language use.",,"Dialogue, Pragmatics, Tree adjoining grammar"

A new approach is proposed which employs attractive and repulsive particle swarm optimization (ARPSO) algorithm for ELD. Incorporation of ARPSO as a derivative-free optimization technique in solving ELD with security (voltages and line-flows) constraints significantly relieves the assumptions imposed on the optimized objective function. The proposed approach has been implemented on three representative systems, i.e. IEEE 14 bus, IEEE 30 bus and IEEE 57 bus systems, respectively. The feasibility of the proposed method is demonstrated and the results are compared with linear programming, quadratic programming and genetic algorithm, respectively. The premature convergence problem, that is common in all evolutionary computation techniques, is solved in ARPSO by including the diversity factor in the Type 1 PSO algorithm. The developed algorithms are computationally faster (in terms of the number of load flows carried out) than the other methods because only one run is required.",,"Power system optimization, Economic load dispatch, Particle swarm optimization, Line-flow, Voltage constraints"

However, research investigating the use of simulations in early years' science learning is limited. This study applied revisions of Kolb's Experiential Learning theoretical model to determine if age-indicated science simulations were effective for teaching 5 year olds simple circuit building procedures and electricity concepts, and the function of circuit components. It also explored whether their engagement with the simulations provided worthwhile opportunities to exercise higher order capabilities such as reflective thinking and abstraction – skills oftencited in literature as valuable outcomes from older student and adult use of simulations. Findings indicate students developed a solid base of procedural knowledge about constructing different circuits, and functional knowledge about circuit components they applied to different circuit designs. The emergence of tentative, generalised theories about current and the effects of different circuit designs on the performance of resistors - linked to the exercise of reflective and descriptive thinking, were also noted in many students. However, examples were found of some simulations appearing to foster common misconceptions, such as current being ‘consumed’ by resistors – indicating teachers need to be highly vigilant and work closely with students, to ensure accurate understandings are developed. Overall, with appropriate teacher support and careful selection and review, the study concludes simulations can be effective for introducing young students to simple physical science concepts, and for providing them with opportunities to engage in higher order thinking processes.",,"Simulations, Young students, Electricity, Circuits, Experiential learning"

In this dichotomy we, i.e., the proponents of the network hypothesis, are inappropriately placed on the Lorenzian line. In particular, we argue that in contrast to Dhein's claim our concepts are not based on merely instinctive or peripheral modes of information processing. In general, on the one side our approaches have largely been motivated by the early biocybernetics way of thinking. On the other side they are deeply rooted in studies on the insect's behavioral ecology, i.e., in the ecological setting within which the navigational strategies have evolved and within which the animal now operates. Following such a bottom-up approach we are not “anti-cognitive map researchers” but argue that the results we have obtained in ants, and also the results of some decisive experiments in bees, can be explained and simulated without the need of invoking metric maps.",,"Insect navigation, Cognitive map, Neural network model, Path integration, Landmark guidance, Ants, Bees"

I argue for the following points: (a) It is highly doubtful that philosophers and cognitive scientists have widely misunderstood CTT as alleged.1 In fact, by and large, computability theorists and mathematical logicians understand CTT in the exact same way. (b) That understanding most likely coincides with what Turing and Church had in mind. Even if it does not, an accurate exegesis of Turing and Church need not dictate how today's working scientists understand the thesis.

Furthermore, these deaths harm education, the economy, and healthcare worldwide. An individual’s persistent feelings and activities, which include sleep disorders such as insomnia, sleeping overtime, or spending the majority of time lying down; pessimistic thinking about the future; and thoughts of committing suicide, help uncover the cause of depression. Several attempts have been made to prevent these losses and deaths. Our study proposes a simple fuzzy inference model that accurately predicts depression levels based on emotions and activities—even with incomplete data and uncertainties—and enhances mental health prediction, bridging theory and practice effectively. Psychologists and professors collaborated to create a survey to collect data for this study. The experiment was conducted using a Google survey form. This method effectively captures the ambiguity and imprecision in depression evaluation by combining linguistic elements of psychological traits. Using the Pearson correlation and R-squared methods, 15 features were chosen from 30 features, followed by five membership functions (poor, mediocre, average, decent, and good) and fuzzy rules to evaluate and create accurate forecasts of depression severity. Our proposed architecture can correctly classify depression levels based on human activities and feelings with 94% accuracy using a less sophisticated rules dictionary than previous pre-trained or hybrid models.

All of these types of representations can be relevant to thinking about quantities, and each supports different kinds of quantity-relevant computations. One way to overcome the three- to four-item limit of WM is to bind together representations of individual objects into representations of sets of objects. Binding multiple individuals into a single higher-order group can increase the number of individual items that can be remembered, as in the well-known demonstrations of chunking by adults. Set representations play a critical role in many numerical processes, including representing the nested relationships between as well as representing the cardinality of an array. Many real-world scenes contain stimuli that do not lend themselves to representation qua individual objects or sets of objects. One can imagine enumerating a flock containing dozens of individual birds.",Academic Press,

Hydrologists, in particular those involved in designing of decision-support tools, are experiencing a widening gap between an academic discipline which has progressively moved away from field-based applied natural science to computational hydrology, and the multiplication of stakeholders involved in the water-related issues addressed by research. The challenge for hydrology is now to negotiate this shift and to rethink its engagement in society. This paper provides a description of a planned process designed to improve hydrology-society interactions and to foster reflexivity in socio-hydrology. Based on an interdisciplinary reflexive process undertaken in Tunisia from 2016 to 2020, we identified three types of discomforts in the dialogue with society, inviting scientists to lucidly engage with these discomforts. We formulated four key reflexive propositions to achieve a better alignment of scientific stance, research practices and discourse. The first proposition concerns the need to explain more clearly the value systems scientists engage in and with society. The second concerns the need to position hydrology in society and not outside it, by reconsidering the functions that research fulfils in society. The third is an invitation to redefine the perimeter of the research interlocutors and the way to reach them. The fourth is to revisit scientific practices to build on the strengths of the dialogue between field-based natural science and computational hydrology. The paper concludes that adopting a reflexive posture towards these four dimensions of the dialogue between hydrology and society is an effective way to overcome discomforts and to refocus research stance, practices and discourse. It is a way to renew hydrology's place in society and to contribute to the current thinking in socio-hydrology initiated by hydrologists.",,"Socio-hydrology, Society, Hydrology, Interdisciplinarity, Reflexivity, Tunisia"

Its dominant paradigms such as utility theory, prospect theory, and the modern dual-process theories all resort to formal algebraic models or non-mathematical postulates, and remain purely phenomenological. An approach introduced by Grossberg deployed differential equations describing neural networks and bridged the gap between decision science and the psychology of cognitive–emotional interactions. However, the limits within which neural models can explain data from real people’s actions are virtually untested and remain unknown. Here we show that a model built around a recurrent gated dipole can successfully forecast individual economic choices in a complex laboratory experiment. Unlike classical statistical and econometric techniques or machine learning algorithms, our method calibrates the equations for each individual separately, and carries out prediction person-by-person. It predicted very well the behaviour of 15%–20% of the participants in the experiment–half of them extremely well–and was overall useful for two thirds of all 211 subjects. The model succeeded with people who were guided by gut feelings and failed with those who had sophisticated strategies. One hypothesis is that this neural network is the biological substrate of the cognitive system for primitive–intuitive thinking, and so we believe that we have a model of how people choose economic options by a simple form of intuition. We anticipate our study to be useful for further studies of human intuitive thinking as well as for analyses of economic systems populated by heterogeneous agents.",,"Decision making, Economic choice, Experimental economics, Gated dipole, Intuitive thinking, Differential equations"

The low image decomposition performance and the unconvincing reconstruction of the approximation image are the two main limitations of the previous methods. In this paper, a new single sample face recognition method based on lower-upper (LU) decomposition algorithm is proposed. The procedure of the proposed method is as following. First, the single sample and its transpose are decomposed to two sets of basis images by using the LU decomposition algorithm, which is more efficient than the image decomposition algorithms of the previous works. Two approximation images are reconstructed from the two basis image sets by the reverse thinking approach based on experimental analysis. Then, the fisher linear discriminant analysis (FLDA) algorithm is used to evaluate the optimal projection space by using the new training set consisting of the single sample and its two approximation images for each person. Finally, the nearest neighbor classifier based on Euclidean distance is adopted as the final classification. We make two main contributions: one is that we propose to decompose the single sample and its transpose using the efficient LU decomposition algorithm, and reorder each basis image set according to the basis image energy; the other is that we present a reverse thinking approach based on experimental analysis to reconstruct the approximation image. The performance of the proposed method is verified using four public face databases, namely FERET, AR, ORL and Yale B.

Amo4ng the shape parameters of shaped holes, the lateral divergence angle (β) and the forward divergence angle (δ) were fixed as 12° and 7° in all shaped holes structures, respectively. The others varied with different regions of the turbine vane. Results showed that different holes fit different positions of vanes. On the suction surface, laidback holes performed the worst net heat flux reduction in most blowing ratios conditions, which indicated the forward divergence angle was not conducive to the flow field and heat transfer characteristics on the suction surface. Whereas, the lateral divergence angle was beneficial to the film cooling and heat transfer characteristics. Laidback fan-shaped holes performed the best adiabatic film cooling effectiveness, but once simultaneously thinking about the heat transfer, fan-shaped holes performed better in net heat flux reduction due to less vortices at holes exit. On the leading edge, the divergence angle towards the upper wall (the lateral divergence angle of spanwise expansion holes) of vanes was not conducive to steady flow. And conical holes performed best, which indicated that coolant from holes with axial divergence angles (the lateral divergence angle in axial direction of conical holes) under the influence of mainstream impact could perform higher film cooling effectiveness and more stable flow fields. On the pressure surface, holes had a lateral divergence angle in the direction of vane height, which was conducive to increasing the coolant coverage area and improving the ability to attach to the pressure surface. Additionally, the laidback hole case was observed the lowest net heat flux reduction when the blowing ratio was less than 2, which revealed that holes that expanded only in flow direction was not conducive to film cooling and heat transfer characteristics.",,"Film cooling, NHFR, Shaped holes, Turbine guide vane"

FEA has been used in bone research for more than 30years and has had a substantial impact on our understanding of the complex behavior of bone. Bone is structured in a hierarchical way covering many length scales and this chapter reflects this hierarchical organization. In particular, the focus is on the applications of FEA for understanding the relationship between bone structure and its mechanical function at specific hierarchical levels. Depending on the hierarchical level, different issues have been investigated with FEA ranging from more clinically oriented topics related to bone quality (e.g., predicting bone strength and fracture risk) to more fundamental problems dealing with the mechanical aspects of biological processes (e.g., stress and strain around osteocyte lacunae) as well as with the micromechanical behavior of bone at its ultrastructure. A better understanding of the relationship between structure and mechanical function is expected to be important for the current trends in (bio)materials design, where the structure of biological materials is considered as a possible source of inspiration, as well as for more successful approaches in the prevention and treatment of age- and disease-related fractures.",Elsevier,"Bone imaging, Bone research, Computational modeling, Femur, Finite element analysis, Fracture, Hierarchical structure, Microcomputed tomography, Osteoporosis, Radius, Strength, Vertebra"

Understanding these linkages is necessary to formulate effective policies that can influence positive outcomes and contribute to the realization of long-term economic, environmental, and social goals. The use of biofuels can help achieve the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and implement the Paris Agreement on climate change. However, the biofuels sector must account for its interdependencies and trade-offs with other sectors. In this study, we formulate a qualitative analytical model that goes beyond the three water-energy-food nexus components by incorporating other elements, such as policy, innovation, governance, and labor to examine their effect as influencing factors and to understand how synergies, trade-offs, and long-overlooked interlinkages between sectors and among existing policies and institutions can become visible. This qualitative model was applied to the case of ethanol in Brazil, for which a large corpus was constructed from the scientific literature, documents and sustainability reports from sugarcane ethanol companies. We used a supervised latent Dirichlet allocation (sLDA) algorithm along with co-occurrence and network analyses. The results demonstrate this approach can be used to evaluate the interfaces between science, policy, and businesses within the WEFL-biofuels nexus. This is done by identifying how best to integrate the development of policies, governance, and stakeholder actions to support cost-effective decisions for optimal resource management and regulatory processes while enabling better integration of scientific insight and policy-making.

In such contexts, the reliability of user texts is often compromised by behavioural and emotional dimensions. To this end, several attempts have been made in the state of the art, to introduce psychological approaches in such systems, including computational psycholinguistics, personality traits and cognitive psychology methods. In contrast, our method is fundamentally different since we employ a psychoanalysis-based approach; in particular, we use the notion of Lacanian discourse types, to capture and deeply understand real (possibly elusive) characteristics, qualities and contents of texts, and evaluate their reliability. As far as we know, this is the first time computational methods are systematically combined with psychoanalysis. We believe such psychoanalytic framework is fundamentally more effective than standard methods, since it addresses deeper, quite primitive elements of human personality, behaviour and expression which usually escape methods functioning at “higher”, conscious layers. In fact, this research is a first attempt to form a new paradigm of psychoanalysis-driven interactive technologies, with broader impact and diverse applications. To exemplify this generic approach, we apply it to the case-study of fake news detection; we first demonstrate certain limitations of the well-known Myers–Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) personality type method, and then propose and evaluate our new method of analysing user texts and detecting fake news based on the Lacanian discourses psychoanalytic approach.",,"Lacanian discourses, Psychoanalysis computing, GPT-3"

OOP deals with structures called objects and allows time and computational effort saving devices such as inheritance, polymorphism and encapsulation. We examine whether the brain itself may use OOP and if representation of objects suffers a breakdown in schizophrenia. Review of literature Previous models fail to provide a unifying explanation with a computational basis that could explain the psychopathology in schizophrenia. METHODS Using the object oriented programming language JavaTM we designed a system of self-objects named ‘hand’, ‘action monitor’ etc interacting with non-self objects ‘scissors’, ‘hammer’, ‘wall’, etc. In computational experiments, we allow the ‘action monitor’ to fail; the features of disparate objects are allowed to merge, some features of an object are allowed to be shared with other objects, etc. Results By transposing only a few lines of code, it is possible to duplicate various features of the psychopathology of schizophrenia. Discussion Our model can demonstrate overinclusion (overabstraction), concrete thinking (underabstraction), loss of ego boundaries (conjoining of disparate objects), delusions (misattribution of object function), lack of insight (poor monitoring of object activity) and passivity (loss of monitoring and misattribution of object activity). Conclusion The brain must use the OOP model in its computations. Failure of object representation and manipulation must lie at the core of the psychopathology of schizophrenia.",,

The introduction of the base isolation system has led to a new concept in the construction panorama in terms of human life safety, a new way of thinking on new constructions, improvement and retrofitting on existent structures. Therefore, rubber and friction isolators have been deeply investigated to hence performances and predict dynamic behaviour during an earthquake. While the response of the former is characterised by the composition of the elastomeric compound, the latter features special materials able to dissipate energy by moving on smooth surfaces. This paper focuses on friction pendulum devices and addresses its attention on the behaviour of sliding materials. It is well-known that stick-slip phenomenon occurs when friction excitation is present and, in the anti-seismic field is important to reduce it and have a well-representative mathematical law able to describe it. Therefore, Hirun International after performing several treatments of the sliding materials has set up a special processing to guarantee a stable response of the HI-M material used on pendulum devices. The paper, after a brief presentation of the special sliding material, shows a comparison between the material with and without the treatment in terms of the force-displacement law. The paper also analyses in detail the cinematic behaviour of the sliding pendulum with one or two main sliding surfaces, with and without central articulation and determines the stress distribution in the sliding surfaces for the different cases.",,"friction coefficient, pendulum device, contact, isolation system"

Research in computational systems biology has moved beyond interaction networks based simply on clustering and correlation. There are two paradigms in computational systems biology: the iterative cycle of biochemical model—mathematical model—computational model, and integration of novel data and legacy knowledge to develop context-specific biochemical, mathematical, and computational models. Challenges in building biochemical models include the complexity of proteomic states and interactions, integration of diverse data to infer biochemical interactions, and the temporal state of biochemical models. Challenges in building mathematical models include incorporating statistical/probabilistic information into analytical models, using qualitative constraints in mathematical models, and incomplete knowledge and coarse-graining. Challenges in computational modeling include the absence of knowledge about model parameters such as rate constants, local versus global concentrations of species and multiple scales of distance and time, and variation among different cell types and subpopulation variability, or variability among biological repeats. Advanced research in coarse graining will pave the way for progress in the development of multiscale multidomain modeling that can connect fundamental research in network biology to clinical research.",Academic Press,

The authors use an orthophotomap obtained from an actual drone to evaluate their algorithm. This can reduce the gap between research and practical operation. However, the approach overlooks the impact of lighting variations on positioning performance, i.e., brightness and color temperature. To address this limitation, we propose a novel CNN architecture to handle lighting variations. Our method improves reliability, accuracy, and computational complexity under varying lighting conditions by incorporating several critical components into the network. Remarkably, our architecture has only 51.35% trainable parameters and 83.97% floating point operations (FLOPs) of the existing one. Still, we can exceed it by 3.73% while not considering light variations and average 2.36% while considering light variations.

It introduces the terms ‘scale’ and ‘scaling’ as methodological metaphors for a researcher’s planned, yet contingent movement through formations of digital textual data that differ in terms of volume, method of collection, processing, and analysis. ‘Scaling-as-method’ aims to replace static binaries (such as ‘micro’ and ‘macro’, ‘small’ and ‘big’ data, ‘manual’ and ‘automated’ processing) by the vision of a researcher who shifts their degree of abstraction, or ‘distance’, towards digital data, while moving from close to distant reading and back again. The paper exemplifies this three-stage process on the example of the indignation mark, aka <!!1>, a twist on the iterated exclamation mark that is attested in digital discourse in various languages as a cue of double-voicing. The explorative examination of a small dataset (Stage 1) leads to the computational collection and distributional analysis of a much larger dataset (‘scaling up’, Stage 2), followed by the manual annotation of a selected subset of this data (‘scaling down’, Stage 3). Each stage draws on a different amount of data, which enables different techniques of processing and analysis, and relies on a specific combination of abductive, deductive, and inductive reasoning. Yet all three stages complement one another in a kaleidoscopic way towards understanding connections between punctuation practices and participatory political discourse online. Scaling as method is not a closed recipe, but an adaptable procedure that can be applied to a variety of discrete digital features. It does not aim to replace established methods of computational social media analysis, but to boost research that is predominantly based on the manual collection and annotation of social media data, and to enables a dialogue between multiple understandings of context.",,"Scaling, Mixed-methods, Digital discourse, Abduction, Indignation mark, Reddit"

We compare two cohorts of Estonian students (1933/36, n=888; 2006, n=912) using the Concepts (Logical Selection) subtest of the Estonian adaptation of the National Intelligence Tests (NIT). The item presentation order of the subtest correlates with the abstractness of the words used in the items (r=.609) of the subtest. The different test results (right, wrong and missing answers) were analysed in order to make an estimate of the FE magnitude. The FE for abstract thinking ability of those samples was 1.06 Hedges' g (adjusted for guessing). The magnitude of the FE is dependent upon the degree of difficulty of the items (an item's difficulty is estimated by determining its abstractness and its familiarity to students). The more difficult part of the subtest (the second half) showed a FE=1.80 whereas the easier part (the first half) of the subtest showed a FE=.72. Word abstractness was a strong predictor of all the testing results in both cohorts (Beta=.700). The familiarity of words used in the test items has no correlation with the test results if word abstractness is controlled in both cohorts. Our findings support Flynn's explanation that the FE is primarily an indicator of the rise in abstract thinking ability.",,"Flynn Effect, National Intelligence Tests, Abstract thinking, Guessing, Tork, Estonia"

In the modeling phase of the life cycle, we focus upon agent representation and specification within the virtual world. In the simulation phase, we discuss the use of scenario planning as the experimentation vehicle. Throughout, we use military recruit market as an example to illustrate the methodology. The benefits of the ALM are (1) it provides a virtual world for continuous computational experimentation, (2) it supports market segmentation by allowing “drilldowns” to finer and finer levels of granularity, and (3) when connected via a common OLAP interface to a “real world” counterpart, it facilitates a tightly integrated, persistent, “sense and respond” decision support functionality.",,"Artificial intelligence, Decision support systems, Simulation, Modelling systems and languages, Economics"

Despite the wide adoptions, mechanistic models are challenged by the complexity of dynamic processes and high computational demands. Data-driven models bring opportunities to capture system complexities and reduce computational cost, by leveraging the abundant data made available by recent advance in sensor technologies. However, the interpretability and data availability hinder their wider adoption. This paper advocates for a paradigm shift in the application of data-driven models within the context of UWS. Integrating existing mechanistic knowledge into data-driven modeling offers a unique solution that reduces data requirements and enhances model interpretability. The knowledge-informed approach balances model complexity with dataset size, enabling more efficient and interpretable modeling in UWS. Furthermore, the integration of mechanistic and data-driven models offers a more accurate representation of UWS dynamics, addressing lingering uncertainties and advancing modelling capabilities. This paper presents perspectives and conceptual framework on developing and implementing knowledge-informed data-driven modeling, highlighting their potential to improve UWS management in the digital era.",,"Modelling, Data-driven, Machine learning, Hybrid model, Urban water systems"

Paranoia is accompanied by significant worry and distress. Identifying cognitive mechanisms underlying paranoia is critical for advancing treatment. We hypothesized that aberrant belief updating, which is related to paranoia in human and animal models, would also contribute to persecutory beliefs in individuals with schizophrenia. Methods Belief updating was assessed in 42 participants with schizophrenia and 44 healthy control participants using a 3-option probabilistic reversal learning task. Hierarchical Gaussian Filter was used to estimate computational parameters of belief updating. Paranoia was measured using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale and the revised Green et al. Paranoid Thoughts Scale. Unusual thought content was measured with the Psychosis Symptom Rating Scale and the Peters et al. Delusions Inventory. Worry was measured using the Dunn Worry Questionnaire. Results Paranoia was significantly associated with elevated win-switch rate and prior beliefs about volatility both in schizophrenia and across the whole sample. These relationships were specific to paranoia and did not extend to unusual thought content or measures of anxiety. We observed a significant indirect effect of paranoia on the relationship between prior beliefs about volatility and worry. Conclusions This work provides evidence that relationships between belief updating parameters and paranoia extend to schizophrenia, may be specific to persecutory beliefs, and contribute to theoretical models implicating worry in the maintenance of persecutory delusions.",,"Belief updating, Computational psychiatry, Delusions, Paranoia, Volatility, Worry"

Although for polymers, the possibility of treating a polymer chain quantum mechanically is formidable, it is clear that the modeling approach allows calculations on monomers, dimmers, and oligomers to guide the interpretation of many spectroscopic observations with great success. For those systems, where longer times scales and larger size scales are important, molecular mechanics and molecular dynamics methods are available, but the issue of the force field and the approximations that it introduces remain significant. The key to the change in attitude to modeling and its role have to lie in the availability of mature algorithms with well-known and well-understood properties. The density functional theory method in quantum mechanics has introduced a new era in applications of quantum mechanical methods.",Elsevier,

These studies were constrained by their reliance on self-report questionnaires as a means of collecting and analysing data. To address this limitation, this study aimed to employ eye-tracking and retrospective think-aloud techniques to identify differences in SRL strategy use for program comprehension tasks between high-performing students (N = 31) and low-performing students (N = 31) in an undergraduate programming course. All participants attended individual eye-tracking sessions to comprehend two Python program codes with different constructs. Their eye-tracking data and video-recalled retrospective think-aloud data were captured and recorded for analysis. The findings reveal that higher-order cognitive skills, such as elaboration and critical thinking, were mostly adopted by high-performing students, while basic cognitive and resource management strategy, such as rehearsal and help-seeking, were mostly employed by low-performing students when comprehending the program codes. This study not only demonstrates the design of combining eye-tracking and retrospective think-aloud data to explore students’ use of SRL strategies but also provides evidence to support the notion that program comprehension is a complex process that cannot be effectively addressed by employing merely rudimentary strategies, such as repetitively reading the same code segment. In the future, researchers could explore the possibility of using a webcam to monitor and assess students’ online programming processes and provide feedback based on their eye movements. They could also examine the effects of SRL strategies training on students’ motivation, engagement, and performance in various types of programming activities.",,"Introductory programming, Self-regulated learning strategies, Eye tracking, Retrospective think aloud, Higher education"

Most complex diseases arise on a background of genetics, lifestyle and environment factors, and manifest themselves as a spectrum of symptoms. To fathom intricate biological processes and their changes from healthy to disease states, we need to systematically integrate and analyze multi-omics datasets, ontologies, and diverse annotations. Without proper management of such complex biological and clinical data, artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms alone cannot be effectively trained, validated, and successfully applied to provide trustworthy and patient-centric diagnosis, prognosis and treatment. Precision medicine requires to use multi-omics approaches effectively, and offers many opportunities for using AI, “big data” analytics, and integrative computational biology workflows. Advances in optical and biochemical assay technologies including sequencing, mass spectrometry and imaging modalities have transformed research by empowering us to simultaneously view all genes expressed, identify proteome-wide changes, and assess interacting partners of each individual protein within a dynamically changing biological system, at an individual cell level. While such views are already having an impact on our understanding of healthy and disease conditions, it remains challenging to extract useful information comprehensively and systematically from individual studies, ensure that signal is separated from noise, develop models, and provide hypotheses for further research. Data remain incomplete and are often poorly connected using fragmented biological networks. In addition, statistical and machine learning models are developed at a cohort level and often not validated at the individual patient level. Combining integrative computational biology and AI has the potential to improve understanding and treatment of diseases by identifying biomarkers and building explainable models characterizing individual patients. From systematic data analysis to more specific diagnostic, prognostic and predictive biomarkers, drug mechanism of action, and patient selection, such analyses influence multiple steps from prevention to disease characterization, and from prognosis to drug discovery. Data mining, machine learning, graph theory and advanced visualization may help identify diagnostic, prognostic and predictive biomarkers, and create causal models of disease. Intertwining computational prediction and modeling with biological experiments leads to faster, more biologically and clinically relevant discoveries. However, computational analysis results and models are going to be only as accurate and useful as correct and comprehensive are the networks, ontologies and datasets used to build them. High quality, curated data portals provide the necessary foundation for translational research. They help to identify better biomarkers, new drugs, precision treatments, and should lead to improved patient outcomes and their quality of life.

This trailing edge noise is emitted from aircraft wings, turbomachinery blades, wind turbine blades, helicopter blades, etc. Being dominant at high frequencies, this trailing-edge noise is a key element that annoys human hearing. This article covers virtually the entire landscape of modern research into trailing-edge noise including theoretical developments, numerical simulations, wind tunnel experiments, and applications of trailing-edge noise. The theoretical approach includes Green’s function formulations, Wiener–Hopf methods that solve the mixed boundary-value problem, Howe’s and Amiet’s models that relate the wall pressure spectrum to acoustic radiation. Recent analytical developments for poroelasticity and serrations are also included. We discuss a hierarchy of numerical approaches that range from semi-empirical schemes that estimate the wall pressure spectrum using mean-flow and turbulence statistics to high-fidelity unsteady flow simulations such as Large Eddy Simulation (LES) or Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) that resolve the sound generation and scattering process based on the first-principles flow physics. Wind tunnel experimental research that provided benchmark data for numerical simulations and unravel flow physics is reviewed. In each theoretical, numerical, and experimental approach, noise control methods for mitigating trailing-edge noise are discussed. Finally, highlights of practical applications of trailing-edge noise prediction and reduction to wind turbine noise, fan noise, and rotorcraft noise are given. The current challenges in each approach are summarized with a look toward the future developments.

In addition, cross-cutting themes were found in Making-based science modeling: first, there are two loops that intersect and interact with each other (modeling for Making and modeling for Science content), and they interrelate in various ways depending on science model type; and second, showcasing Making products (sharing with peers, teachers, or helpers) is a primary factor that determines students’ overall engagement with science in the activity. We suggest that Making-based science kit and lesson design needs to support students to showcase their Making output, on top of science-related reflections, and to consider the balance between Making and science activity.

A problem that can arise in using abstraction is the generation of abstract states, called spurious states, from which the goal state is reachable in the abstract space but for which there is no corresponding state in the original space from which the goal state can be reached. Spurious states can be harmful, in practice, because they can create artificial shortcuts in the abstract space that slow down planning and search, and they can greatly increase the memory needed to store heuristic information derived from the abstract space (e.g., pattern databases). This paper analyzes the computational complexity of creating abstractions that do not contain spurious states. We define a property—the downward path preserving property (DPP)—that formally captures the notion that an abstraction does not result in spurious states. We then analyze the computational complexity of (i) testing the downward path preserving property for a given state space and abstraction and of (ii) determining whether this property is achievable at all for a given state space. The strong hardness results shown carry over to typical description languages for planning problems, including sas+ and propositional strips. On the positive side, we identify and illustrate formal conditions under which finding downward path preserving abstractions is provably tractable.",,"Abstraction, Heuristic search, Planning"

Although various data mining methods have been applied to improve the effectiveness of IDS, research regarding IDSs having high detection rates and better runtime performance (i.e., lower computational cost) is ongoing.

In the literature, the feature selection methods (i.e., filter and wrapper) have been widely used for the dimensionality reduction in IDSs. Although the wrapper feature selection techniques outperform the filters, they are time-consuming. Again, the ensemble classifiers can achieve higher detection rates for IDSs compared to the stand-alone classifiers, but they require more computation time to build the model. In order to improve the runtime performance and the detection rate of IDS, a swift wrapper feature selection and a speedy ensemble classifier are proposed in this study. For the dimensionality reduction, the swift wrapper feature selection (i.e., DBDE-QDA) is used, which consists of dichotomous binary differential evolution (DBDE) and quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA). For attack detection, the speedy ensemble classifier is used, which combines Holte's 1R, random tree, and reduced error pruning tree. In the experiments, the NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, and CICDDoS2019 datasets are used. According to the experimental results, the proposed IDS reaches 95%–97.4%, 82.7%, and 99.5%–99.9% detection rates for the NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, and CICDDoS2019 datasets. In this way, the proposed IDS competes with the state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection rate and false alarm rate. In addition, the proposed IDS has a lower computational cost than the state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, DBDE-QDA reduces the dimension by 60.97%–82.92%, 73.46%, and 96.55%–98.85% for the NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, and CICDoS2019 datasets.",,"Data mining, Ensemble classifier, Feature selection, Intrusion detection system"

However, the field has primarily focused on model accuracy in predicting performance on a task or a diagnostic category. Instead the field should be more focused on determining which computational analyses align best with the targeted neurocognitive/psychological functions that we want to assess. In this paper we reflect on two decades of experience with the application of language-based assessment to patients' mental state and cognitive function by addressing the questions of what we are measuring, how it should be measured and why we are measuring the phenomena. We address the questions by advocating for a principled framework for aligning computational models to the constructs being assessed and the tasks being used, as well as defining how those constructs relate to patient clinical states. We further examine the assumptions that go into the computational models and the effects that model design decisions may have on the accuracy, bias and generalizability of models for assessing clinical states. Finally, we describe how this principled approach can further the goal of transitioning language-based computational assessments to part of clinical practice while gaining the trust of critical stakeholders.",,"Natural language processing, Speech technologies, Artificial intelligence"

How to capture the crucial features of influential nodes without increasing the computational complexity is an urgent issue to be solved in the context of big data. Laplacian centrality (LC) measures nodal influence by computing nodes' degree, making it extremely low complexity. However, there is still significant room for improvement. Consequently, we propose the improved Laplacian centrality (ILC) to identify influential nodes based on the concept of self-consistent. Identifying results on 9 real networks prove that ILC is superior to LC and other 6 classical measures in terms of ranking accuracy, top-k nodes identification and discrimination capability. Moreover, the computational complexity of ILC has not significantly increased compared to LC, and remains the linear order of magnitude O(m). Additionally, ILC has excellent robustness and universality such that there is no need to adjust parameters according to different network structures.",,"Social network, Influential nodes, Centrality measure, Improved Laplacian centrality"

Such online research, though well-suited to qualitative analysis, leads to a number of practical problems in terms of range, depth, and ease of access to data. Even extensive data collection and manual analysis often only engage with a small percentage of the data available in online communities.

This analysis revealed five themes of forum use: preference sharing, personal narrative sharing, practical advice, philosophical issues, and community maintenance. Further automated data collection and corpus analysis, such as keyness and topic modelling, are presented as a potential innovation within online qualitative research. This approach allowed for the analysis of a larger dataset of 255,891 posts, across 14,232 threads (16,472,006 words), revealing additional themes such as sexual hygiene, desire, legality, and ethnicity, as well as differences in the use of terms of address and slang by punters and sex workers.

Previous research has pointed to subgroups of autisticWoID children who display difficulty with mathematics and reading achievement (Chen et al., 2018; Estes et al., 2011; Jones et al., 2009; Wei et al., 2015). Research has primarily focused on symptomatology and communication factors related to learning in subgroups of autistic children. The current study sought to expand upon this research by assessing the validity of these previous studies and by investigating the specific contribution of domain-general cognitive abilities to differences in these subgroups. Method Seventy-eight autisticWoID individuals (M = 11.34 years, SD = 2.14) completed measures of mathematics and reading achievement, IQ, working memory, inferential thinking, and Theory of Mind (ToM). A hierarchical cluster analysis was performed on the math and reading measures. Results The analysis revealed two unique achievement groups: one group that performed lower than expected on math and reading achievement and a second group that performed higher than expected. Groups differed significantly on IQ and working memory and were distinguished by performance on reading fluency. Groups did not differ on ToM, inferential thinking, or symptomatology.

This paper presents an extensive review of the literature in V&V in computational fluid dynamics (CFD), discusses methods and procedures for assessing V&V, and develops a number of extensions to existing ideas. The review of the development of V&V terminology and methodology points out the contributions from members of the operations research, statistics, and CFD communities. Fundamental issues in V&V are addressed, such as code verification versus solution verification, model validation versus solution validation, the distinction between error and uncertainty, conceptual sources of error and uncertainty, and the relationship between validation and prediction. The fundamental strategy of verification is the identification and quantification of errors in the computational model and its solution. In verification activities, the accuracy of a computational solution is primarily measured relative to two types of highly accurate solutions: analytical solutions and highly accurate numerical solutions. Methods for determining the accuracy of numerical solutions are presented and the importance of software testing during verification activities is emphasized. The fundamental strategy of validation is to assess how accurately the computational results compare with the experimental data, with quantified error and uncertainty estimates for both. This strategy employs a hierarchical methodology that segregates and simplifies the physical and coupling phenomena involved in the complex engineering system of interest. A hypersonic cruise missile is used as an example of how this hierarchical structure is formulated. The discussion of validation assessment also encompasses a number of other important topics. A set of guidelines is proposed for designing and conducting validation experiments, supported by an explanation of how validation experiments are different from traditional experiments and testing. A description is given of a relatively new procedure for estimating experimental uncertainty that has proven more effective at estimating random and correlated bias errors in wind-tunnel experiments than traditional methods. Consistent with the authors’ contention that nondeterministic simulations are needed in many validation comparisons, a three-step statistical approach is offered for incorporating experimental uncertainties into the computational analysis. The discussion of validation assessment ends with the topic of validation metrics, where two sample problems are used to demonstrate how such metrics should be constructed. In the spirit of advancing the state of the art in V&V, the paper concludes with recommendations of topics for future research and with suggestions for needed changes in the implementation of V&V in production and commercial software.",,

This study addressed this gap by comprehensively investigating the moderating role of SES in the relationship between EF subcomponents (i.e., interference inhibition, response inhibition, and working memory) and children’s concurrent and future mathematical abilities (i.e., arithmetic operations and logical–visuospatial skills). A total of 172 participants (Mage = 6.78 years; 107 boys) took part in the study at the beginning of first grade in elementary school (T1) and 20 months later (T2). We measured EFs, SES, and mathematical ability at T1 and mathematical ability at T2. Results from hierarchical linear regression models indicated that working memory was positively associated with T1 arithmetic operations and logical–visuospatial skills as well as with T2 arithmetic operations. Furthermore, family SES was positively associated with arithmetic operations at both T1 and T2. Notably, we found a significant interaction effect between interference inhibition and SES on T1 arithmetic operations and logical–visuospatial skills. Specifically, interference inhibition was positively related to T1 arithmetic operations and logical–visuospatial skills for children from low- and middle-SES families, but not for children from high-SES families.

In vitro NAMs such as microphysiological systems, microelectrode array and ion channel panels could then be employed to address hypothetical risks. Finally, the safety of first time in human trials could be assessed and assured using circulating nanobots that measure conventional clinical pathology parameters alongside new biomarkers such as circulating tissue DNA.

For all students, there were significant increases in entity beliefs and significant decreases in incremental beliefs across the semester. However, examination of effect sizes suggests that significant findings for change across time were driven by changes in specific subpopulations of students. Moreover, results showed that students endorsed incremental belief more strongly than entity belief at both the beginning and end of the semester. Furthermore, the magnitude of changes differed based on students’ motivated self-regulated engagement profiles. Additionally, students’ achievement outcomes were weakly predicted by their implicit beliefs of intelligence. Finally, results showed that the relationship between changes in implicit intelligence beliefs and student achievement varied across different CS1 courses.

Expectations about durations enable us to prepare for important events in good time, but also to detect irregularities. Unfortunately, time perception is not invariant. Situational aspects as well as features of the task at hand may dramatically change our sense of time. Particularly under varying workload conditions, temporal distortions may lead to performance errors. A valid and reliable model of time perception must account for these characteristics. Based on the cognitive architecture ACT-R (Anderson et al., 2004), we developed a computational model in line with this requirement. Specific emphasis was placed on mechanisms of coordinative working memory which seem to influence time encoding and perception. The model’s assumptions were tested in three steps. First, the model was applied to account for time distortions ‘a posteriori’. Effects of varying working memory demands reported by Dutke (2005) were replicated and explained by simulations of the model. Second, the model was used for predicting effects ‘a priori’. Augmenting Dutke’s (2005) approach by switching between different degrees of memory demands, predictions of time distortions were derived from the model. These predictions were compared with experimental data. Central assumptions of the model were supported, but there were also some deviations that the model had not captured. Based on the conclusions from the results of the experiment, a second a priori testing addressed temporal expectations in a complex task using a micro-world scenario. The results support the interpretation of the previous experiment and provide new insights for modelling time perception. In summary, our results indicate that coordinative working memory – in contrast to general attention – causes differences in timing performance. This characteristic is captured by our approach. The model we propose heavily relies on mechanisms of working memory and can be applied to explain effects for different time intervals, under a variety of experimental conditions and in different task environments.",,"Cognitive modelling, Time perception, Working memory, Expectations, Surprise, ACT-R"

Here we combine these concepts by examining the cognitive and behavioral outcomes of certainty about the future during periods of societal uncertainty. Three studies (N = 1218) examined future certainty, defined as feeling certain about some future event or outcome, during two major societal events of uncertainty—the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election. In Study 1, certainty about positive or negative futures of COVID-19 (e.g., the pandemic will end soon; the pandemic will never end) predicted poorer information seeking—ignorance of medical experts, adherence to conspiratorial thinking, and lower objective knowledgeability about COVID-19. Building on these findings, in Study 2, future certainty predicted antisocial health behaviors, including failing to social distance. Study 3 extended these findings to the political domain—the 2020 Presidential Election. Future certainty that one's preferred candidate would win the election predicted poor information seeking and antisocial behaviors in terms of claiming that the election was rigged, endorsing violence if one's candidate lost, and, among Trump supporters, identifying with Capitol insurrectionists. These findings suggest that future certainty is linked to intellectual blindness and antisocial behaviors during important periods of societal uncertainty.",,"Subjective certainty, Future thinking, COVID-19, Elections, Information seeking, Uncertainty"

However, unlike humans who can instinctively adapt their problem-solving strategies to the complexity of task, most LLM-based methods adopt a one-size-fits-all approach. These methods employ consistent models, sample sizes, prompting methods and levels of problem decomposition, regardless of the problem complexity. The inflexibility of these methods can bring unnecessary computational overhead or sub-optimal performance. To address this limitation, we introduce an Adaptive-Solver (AS) framework that dynamically adapts solving strategies to suit various problems, enabling the flexible allocation of test-time computational resources. The framework functions with two primary modules. The initial evaluation module assesses the reliability of the current solution using answer consistency. If the solution is deemed unreliable, the subsequent adaptation module comes into play. Within this module, various types of adaptation strategies are employed collaboratively. Through such dynamic and multi-faceted adaptations, our framework can help reduce computational consumption and improve performance. Experimental results from complex reasoning benchmarks reveal that our method can significantly reduce API costs (up to 85%) while maintaining original performance. Alternatively, it achieves up to 4.5% higher accuracy compared to the baselines at the same cost.

Cluster analysis was used to group students' creativity levels. A multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was conducted to test differences in cognitive abilities across the three clusters. Group differences between high and moderate level creativity students and low creativity students were found regarding VP abilities in the following tests: VSWM, visual discrimination (VD), and Raven's Colored Progressive Matrices (RCPM). Group differences between high creativity students and low creativity students were also found on verbal STM and WM.

Online peer support networks can be highly engaging, but they show mixed results and lack evidence-based content. Objective Our aim was to introduce and evaluate a novel Web-based, peer-to-peer cognitive reappraisal platform designed to promote evidence-based techniques, with the hypotheses that (1) repeated use of the platform increases reappraisal and reduces depression and (2) that the social, crowdsourced interactions enhance engagement. Methods Participants aged 18-35 were recruited online and were randomly assigned to the treatment group, “Panoply” (n=84), or an active control group, online expressive writing (n=82). Both are fully automated Web-based platforms. Participants were asked to use their assigned platform for a minimum of 25 minutes per week for 3 weeks. Both platforms involved posting descriptions of stressful thoughts and situations. Participants on the Panoply platform additionally received crowdsourced reappraisal support immediately after submitting a post (median response time=9 minutes). Panoply participants could also practice reappraising stressful situations submitted by other users. Online questionnaires administered at baseline and 3 weeks assessed depression symptoms, reappraisal, and perseverative thinking. Engagement was assessed through self-report measures, session data, and activity levels. Results The Panoply platform produced significant improvements from pre to post for depression (P=.001), reappraisal (P<.001), and perseverative thinking (P<.001). The expressive writing platform yielded significant pre to post improvements for depression (P=.02) and perseverative thinking (P<.001), but not reappraisal (P=.45). The two groups did not diverge significantly at post-test on measures of depression or perseverative thinking, though Panoply users had significantly higher reappraisal scores (P=.02) than expressive writing. We also found significant group by treatment interactions. Individuals with elevated depression symptoms showed greater comparative benefit from Panoply for depression (P=.02) and perseverative thinking (P=.008). Individuals with baseline reappraisal deficits showed greater comparative benefit from Panoply for depression (P=.002) and perseverative thinking (P=.002). Changes in reappraisal mediated the effects of Panoply, but not the expressive writing platform, for both outcomes of depression (ab=-1.04, SE 0.58, 95% CI -2.67 to -.12) and perseverative thinking (ab=-1.02, SE 0.61, 95% CI -2.88 to -.20). Dropout rates were similar for the two platforms; however, Panoply yielded significantly more usage activity (P<.001) and significantly greater user experience scores (P<.001). Conclusions Panoply engaged its users and was especially helpful for depressed individuals and for those who might ordinarily underutilize reappraisal techniques. Further investigation is needed to examine the long-term effects of such a platform and whether the benefits generalize to a more diverse population of users.

We validated the scale using Confirmatory Factory Analysis and Structural Equation Modeling with responses from over 6000 4th-6th grade students (aged 9–12 years). Survey validation revealed a scale consisting of five constructs that comprise young learners' attitudes toward coding: social value, coding confidence, coding interest, perception of coders, and coding utility. In our analysis, students' grade level, ethnicity, gender, coding frequency, coding experience, and math interest influenced social value, which in turn influenced coding interest, perception of coders, and coding utility. Students' math confidence, coding frequency, coding experience, ethnicity, and coding interest predicted their coding confidence. Among observable variables, coding frequency and math interest had the greatest influence on social value, which substantially influenced all other factors. We discuss how this tool can help those who teach coding to young children to better measure and understand the variables that may influence young learners’ attitudes toward coding over time.",,"Elementary education, Computational thinking, Coding, Attitude scale, Instrument validation"

A critical component of this control system is forward sensory prediction, which affords a natural mechanism for limited motor influence on perception, as recent perceptual research has suggested. Evidence shows that this influence is modulatory but not necessary for speech perception.

In the current work, we reviewed (1) how conceptual knowledge is defined in the mathematical thinking literature, and (2) how conceptual knowledge is defined, operationalized, and measured in three mathematical domains: equivalence, cardinality, and inversion. We uncovered three general issues. First, few investigators provide explicit definitions of conceptual knowledge. Second, the definitions that are provided are often vague or poorly operationalized. Finally, the tasks used to measure conceptual knowledge do not always align with theoretical claims about mathematical understanding. Together, these three issues make it challenging to understand the development of conceptual knowledge, its relationship to procedural knowledge, and how it can best be taught to students.

For instance, it is used locally, as part of a sensor system, on the edge for low-latency high-performance inference, or in the cloud, e.g. for data mining. Modern complex systems, such as connected vehicles, are often part of an Internet of Things (IoT). This poses additional architectural challenges. To manage complexity, architectures are described with architecture frameworks, which are composed of a number of architectural views connected through correspondence rules. Despite some attempts, the definition of a mathematical foundation for architecture frameworks that are suitable for the development of distributed AI systems still requires investigation and study. In this paper, we propose to extend the state of the art on architecture framework by providing a mathematical model for system architectures, which is scalable and supports co-evolution of different aspects for example of an AI system. Based on Design Science Research, this study starts by identifying the challenges with architectural frameworks in a use case of distributed AI systems. Then, we derive from the identified challenges four rules, and we formulate them by exploiting concepts from category theory. We show how compositional thinking can provide rules for the creation and management of architectural frameworks for complex systems, for example distributed systems with AI. The aim of the paper is not to provide viewpoints or architecture models specific to AI systems, but instead to provide guidelines based on a mathematical formulation on how a consistent framework can be built up with existing, or newly created, viewpoints. To put in practice and test the approach, the identified and formulated rules are applied to derive an architectural framework for the EU Horizon 2020 project “Very efficient deep learning in the IoT” (VEDLIoT) in the form of a case study.",,"AI systems, Architectural frameworks, Compositional thinking, Requirements engineering, Systems engineering"

This two-part series aims to demonstrate the basic principles, methodology and specific examples of active learning with formative assessment implemented to achieve improved student academic performance. In this part I of the two-part series, firstly, a detailed description is introduced of the cognitive learning methodology which makes use of student-centered recognition, analysis and synthesis for decision-making when there is no entirely right or wrong decision. The concept of “decision situation” is described which combines several surrounding and contingency elements to arrive at a demonstration of the holistic decision-making through systems analysis. A Holistic thinking approach is further developed using a systems learning methodology that combines normative with descriptive analyses to arrive at a cognitive mode model of judgement and choice. Sustainability modelling using the three-gateway systems approach is introduced and compared with the multi-layered view of chemical and biochemical engineering education and research; see Gani et al. (2020). Holistic thinking strategy is applied most recently to integrating, backcasting and eco-design for the circular economy (CE); see Mendoza et al. (2017). A student-centred learning approach is advocated that makes use of these principles and enables the systematic embedding of sustainability modeling in industrial and economic activities whose success rely substantively on decision-making. Finally, the relative importance is evaluated using classroom data available with specific engineering topics of the didactic “rule-based” methods of knowledge transfer in contrast with the experiential accumulation of practical information amassed through social interactions in a co-operative learning environment that relies on sustained improvement through active communication and feedback between the teacher/instructor and the student/learner; see Stephan et al.

Affected individuals may experience anger, irritability, annoyance, disgust, and anxiety, as well as physiological autonomic responses, and may find everyday environments and contexts to be unbearable in which their ‘misophonic stimuli’ (often called ‘trigger sounds’) are present. Misophonia is gradually being recognized as a genuine problem that causes significant distress and has negative consequences for individuals and their families. It has only recently come under scientific scrutiny, as researchers and clinicians are establishing its prevalence, distinguishing it from other disorders of sensory sensitivity such as hyperacusis, establishing its neurobiological bases, and evaluating the effectiveness of potential treatments. While ideas abound as to the mechanisms involved in misophonia, few have coalesced into models. The aim of the present work is to summarize and extend recent thinking on the mechanistic basis of misophonia, with a focus on moving towards neurologically-informed cognitive models that can (a) account for extant findings, and (b) generate testable predictions. We hope this work will facilitate future refinements in our understanding of misophonia, and ultimately inform treatments.",,"Misophonia, Cognitive science, Cognitive neuroscience, Sound sensitivity, Models"

In order to overcome rigid thinking of causal factors within a structured framework and incorporate features of different accidents, this study adopted grounded theory for the investigation on factors contributing to workplace accidents in subway construction. The deep reinforcement learning model of double deep Q-network (DDQN) was developed for predicting subway construction safety risk, which integrated the advantage of reinforcement learning in decision making with the advantage of deep learning in objection perception. The findings denoted that DDQN performed better than other machine learning models inclusive of random forest, extreme gradient boosting, k-nearest neighbor, and support vector machine. Contributing factors relevant to subway construction accidents were quantitatively analyzed using permutation importance of attributes. It was beneficial for determining how the 37 contributing factors had negative effects on subway construction safety risk. Safety measures for risk reduction and controlling could be optimized according to permutation importance of individual contributing factor, which paved a new way for the promotion of safety management performance at subway construction sites.",,"Subway construction safety, Grounded theory, Deep reinforcement learning, Double deep Q-network, Permutation importance"

These applications range from cable and current limiters to sensors. These multiscale systems lead to challenging problems of connecting micro- or meso-structural features to macroscopic materials response, i.e. permittivity, conductivity. This article first reviews progress made at that time of the underlying physics of dielectric heterostructures and points out the missing elements that have led to a resurgence of interest in these and related materials. Recent advances in computational electromagnetics provide unparalleled control over morphology in this class of materials to produce a seemingly unlimited number of exquisitely structured materials endowed with tailored electromagnetic, and other physical properties. In the text to follow, we illustrate how an ab initio computational technique can be used to accurately characterize structure–dielectric property relationships of periodic heterostructures in the quasistatic limit. More specifically, we have carried out two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) numerical studies of two-component materials in which equal-sized inclusions, with shape and orientation and possibly fused together, are fixed in a periodic square (2D) or cubic (3D) array. Boundary-integral equations (BIE) are derived from Green's theorem and are solved for the local field with appropriate periodicity conditions on a unit cell of the structures using the field calculation package PHI3D. A number of illustrative examples shows how this computational technique can provide very accurate predictions for the complex effective permittivity of translationally-invariant heterostructures. The performance of the method is also compared with those of other computational and analytical techniques. We comment on how this computational method helps identify some important characteristics for rationalizing and predicting the structure of composite materials in terms of the nature, size, shape and orientation of their constituents.",,

Since the early 2010s scholars and journalists have critiqued the smart city paradigm and examined its various projects and experimental initiatives to surface its ethical dimensions and significance. The smart city's rhetorical swing from tech-centric to human-centric and from smart city to smart citizen is construed here as a further effort to create the image of a more ethical smart city. Consequently, the topic of ethics has also intersected with the smart city in particular ways, and predominantly through the lens of data governance and the protection of privacy rights. This chapter argues for an expanded approach to smart city ethics. It proposes a focus on urban technology design to bridge the gap between a micro-ethical focus on data ethics and macro-level political-ethical critique. Bringing philosophical thinking on technology together with a design-led approach to urban technology is argued to provide a further way to draw out a potentially different set of ethical concerns and to explore how urban life can be lived with technology.",Elsevier,"Design, process, Ethics, Ethics by design, Material ethics, Philosophy of technology, Postphenomenology, Practical ethics, Smart city, Urban technology, Value-sensitive design"

Although cooling ages in denuded settings are commonly linked to exhumation, such data are not related to instantaneous behavior but rather to an integration of the exhumation rates experienced between the thermochronological ‘closure’ at depth and subsequent exposure at the surface. The short spatial wavelength variation of thermal structure and denudation rate typical of orogenic regions thus renders thermochronometers sensitive to lateral motion during exhumation. The significance of this lateral motion varies in proportion with closure temperature, which controls the depth at which isotopic closure occurs, and hence, the range of time and length scales over which such data integrate sample histories. Different chronometers thus vary in the fundamental aspects of the orogenic character to which they are sensitive. Isotopic systems with high closure temperature are more sensitive to exhumation paths and the variation in denudation and thermal structure across a region, while those of lower closure temperature constrain shorter-term behaviour and more local conditions. Discounting lateral motion through an orogenic region and interpreting cooling ages purely in terms of vertical exhumation can produce ambiguous results because variation in the cooling rate can result from either change in kinematics over time or the translation of samples through spatially varying conditions. Resolving this ambiguity requires explicit consideration of the physical and thermal framework experienced by samples during their exhumation. This can be best achieved through numerical simulations coupling kinematic deformation to thermal evolution. Such an approach allows the thermochronological implications of different kinematic scenarios to be tested, and thus provides an important means of assessing the contribution of lateral motion to orogenic evolution.",,"Lateral motion, Thermochronology, Orogenic regions"

We seek to overcome this problem by using our ‘privileged’ sense of vision. This means that we render dynamic, multi-modal phenomena as graphic depictions, be they technical visualizations, thought experiments, logic constructions or network graphs. The ‘graphic act’ has been described a being a fundamental activity in human perception, and both scientists and artists have undertaken advanced analyses of the human perception of nature based on visual experiments. Analysis based on reasoning is similarly a graphic act, in the sense that it seeks out patterns of connectivity among socio-spatial agents and entities. Reasoning also depends upon symbolism, which serves to overcome the problem of infinity in nature (a matter that lies at the heart of machine computation). Hence, this chapter introduces some elements in logical reasoning, set theory and computation, and outlines the particular importance of working with symbols. It also provides an introduction to data modelling with graphs, including current advances in graph databases. It provides some ‘tools for thinking’ about knowledge complexity and suggests the potential power in adapting these technologies to organize knowledge of dynamic, complex domains.

These approaches include functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), functional connectivity analysis, individual difference analysis, and computational modeling. A graded fMRI paradigm compared the brain activation during the solution of problems with varying path lengths: easy (1 and 2 moves), moderate (3 and 4 moves) and difficult (5 and 6 moves). There were three central findings regarding the prefrontal cortex: (1) while both the left and right prefrontal cortices were equally involved during the solution of moderate and difficult problems, the activation on the right was differentially attenuated during the solution of the easy problems; (2) the activation observed in the right prefrontal cortex was highly correlated with individual differences in working memory (measured independently by the reading span task); and (3) different patterns of functional connectivity were observed in the left and right prefrontal cortices. Results obtained from the superior parietal region also revealed left/right differences; only the left superior parietal region revealed an effect of difficulty. These fMRI results converged upon two hypotheses: (1) the right prefrontal area may be more involved in the generation of a plan, whereas the left prefrontal area may be more involved in plan execution; and (2) the right superior parietal region is more involved in attention processes while the left homologue is more of a visuo-spatial workspace. A 4CAPS computational model of the cognitive processes and brain activation in the TOL task integrated these hypothesized mechanisms, and provided a reasonably good fit to the observed behavioral and brain activation data. The multiple research approaches presented here converge on a deepening understanding of the combination of perceptual and conceptual processes in this type of visual problem solving.",,"Planning, fMRI, Spatial working memory, Problem solving, Tower of London, Computational modeling, 4CAPS"

It compounds the difficulty of this challenge by traditionally seeking to explain the phenomenon in strictly mental terms. Rather, we suggest that thoughts and actions are bound to objects, inviting a granular description of the world within which thinking proceeds. As the reasoner transforms the world, the physical traces of these changes can be mapped in space and time. Not only can the reasoner see these changes, and act upon them, the researcher can develop new inscription devices that captures the trajectory of the creative arc along spatial and temporal coordinates. Kinenoetic is a term we employ to capture the idea that knowledge comes from the movement of objects and that this knowledge is both at the level of the problem-solver and at the level of the researcher. This form of knowledge can only be constructed in problem solving environments where reasoners can manipulate physical elements.

It is able to reproduce the Gompertz law of mortality and can make predictions about the relation between the level of mutation rates (beneficial/deleterious/neutral), age at reproductive maturity and the degree of biological aging. With no mutations, a population with low age at reproductive maturity R stabilizes at higher density values, while with mutations it reaches its maximum density, because even for large pre-reproductive periods each individual evolves to survive to maturity. Species with very short pre-reproductive periods can only tolerate a small number of detrimental mutations. The probabilities of detrimental (Pd) or beneficial (Pb) mutations are demonstrated to greatly affect the process. High absolute values produce peaks in the viability of the population over time. Mutations combined with low selection pressure move the system towards weaker phenotypes. For low values in the ratio Pd/Pb, the speed at which aging occurs is almost independent of R, while higher values favor significantly species with high R. The value of R is critical to whether the population survives or dies out. The aging rate is controlled by Pd and Pb and the amount of the viability of each individual is modified, with neutral mutations allowing the system more “room” to evolve. The process of aging in this simple model is revealed to be fairly complex, yielding a rich variety of results.",,"Evolution, Aging, Computer simulations, Age-structured populations, Modelling"

In real-world decision-making, such a sequential approach is useful to make faster decisions for some objects with the lower cost of decision process and the acceptable accuracy when information is insufficient or unavailable. However, the cost of time-consuming computation for hierarchical multilevel granularity is our concern. To address this issue, we utilize a local strategy to accelerate a sequence of neighborhood-based granulation induced by Gaussian kernel function. Subsequently, local three-way decision rules are investigated based on the Bayesian minimum risk criterion. Moreover, by the construction of a novel local trisection model, we propose a local sequential approach of three-way granular computing under a temporal-spatial multilevel granular structure.

Combining functional magnetic resonance imaging with functional connectivity and diffusion tensor imaging-based probabilistic tractography, we examined the brain network involved in the recognition and integration of words and chords that were not hierarchically related to the preceding syntax; that is, those deviating from the universal principles of grammar and tonal relatedness. This kind of syntactic processing in both domains was found to rely on a shared network in the left hemisphere centered on the inferior part of the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), including pars opercularis and pars triangularis, and on dorsal and ventral long association tracts connecting this brain area with temporo-parietal regions. Language processing utilized some adjacent left hemispheric IFG and middle temporal regions more than music processing, and music processing also involved right hemisphere regions not activated in language processing. Our data indicate that a dual-stream system with dorsal and ventral long association tracts centered on a functionally and structurally highly differentiated left IFG is pivotal for domain–general syntactic competence over a broad range of elements including words and chords.",,

New, artificial pathways promise higher yields and activity than natural ones like the Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) cycle. The question remains how to best predict their in vivo performance and what actually makes one pathway “better” than another. In this context, we explore aerobic carbon fixation pathways by a computational approach and compare them based on their specific activity and yield on methanol, formate, and CO2/H2 considering the kinetics and thermodynamics of the reactions. Besides pathways found in nature or implemented in the laboratory, this included two completely new cycles with favorable features: the reductive citramalyl-CoA cycle and the 2-hydroxyglutarate-reverse tricarboxylic acid cycle. A comprehensive kinetic data set was collected for all enzymes of all pathways, and missing kinetic data were sampled with the Parameter Balancing algorithm. Kinetic and thermodynamic data were fed to the Enzyme Cost Minimization algorithm to check for respective inconsistencies and calculate pathway-specific activities. The specific activities of the reductive glycine pathway, the CETCH cycle, and the new reductive citramalyl-CoA cycle were predicted to match the best natural cycles with superior product-substrate yield. However, the CBB cycle performed better in terms of activity compared to the alternative pathways than previously thought. We make an argument that stoichiometric yield is likely not the most important design criterion of the CBB cycle. Still, alternative carbon fixation pathways were paretooptimal for specific activity and product-substrate yield in simulations with C1 substrates and CO2/H2 and therefore hold great potential for future applications in Industrial Biotechnology and Synthetic Biology.",,

Rather than to implement the innovative design by computers, this environment is used to stimulate the imagination of designers and extend their thinking space. It wants to explore a feasible and useful evolutionary approach in a distributed environment that will give the designers concrete help for the creative designs. This approach is illustrated by a mobile phone design example, which used binary algebraic expression tree to form sketch shapes and a feature based product tree to produce component combination choices. Because evolution is guided by human selectors, the evolutionary algorithm is not complex.

An analytical solution is found to the resulting ODE for a specific choice of one of the hardening model’s parameters. That solution is used to prove that if the prescribed density rise is allowed to be infinitely thin, i.e., like a shock in the mathematical sense, the resulting deviatoric stress is still bounded. In other words, the singularity is integrable; integration of the radial return ODE regularizes the infinite strain rate and resulting yield stress in the presence of an ideal shock singularity. The analytical tools developed for this line of thinking are applied to study the variation of deviatoric stress through a nearly shock-like density rise using different density rise profiles, revealing the impact of the shape choice. The tools are also used to compute what rise times are needed to converge upon the correct value of deviatoric stress through a shock; the results indicate that most contemporary hydrocodes cannot be expected to achieve those rise times. A demonstration of connecting the analytical tools to a hydrocode, using surrogate numerical shock shapes, is provided thereby opening the door for using such surrogates to perform sub-grid computations of converged shock behavior for strain-rate hardening materials.",,"Shocks, Plasticity, Hardening, Hydrodynamics, Radial return"

However, relevant studies tend to overlook the temporal dimension of social media, potentially systematic patterning of linguistic behavior across time, and the attendant implications of such a temporal perspective on identity. Combining an automated lexical tool (LIWC) and the Box–Jenkins method of statistical time series analysis, this paper shows how the ‘modelability’ of linguistic choices across time can be interpreted as signatures of identity construction and complement existing frameworks for identity analysis. Two levels of modelability are discussed—the availability of a well-fitting time series model as evidence of temporal patterning, and specific parameters of that model interpreted in context. These are demonstrated with a case study of the construction of ‘amateur expertise’ over 109 consecutive makeup tutorial videos on the popular YouTube channel ‘Nikkiestutorials’. Results show that the linguistic display of ‘analytical thinking’ reflects a strategy of ‘short term momentum’, the display of ‘clout’ and ‘authenticity’ a strategy of ‘short term restoration’, while the display of ‘emotional tone’ fluctuates randomly across time. The approach is further discussed in terms of its general principles and potential applications in other contexts of identity and related research.",,"Identity construction, Social media, LIWC, Modelability, ARIMA, Time series analysis"

However, when there is a novel or atypical decision to be made, we must rely on a slower and more deliberative thought process—analytical reasoning. As we gain experience with these novel or atypical decisions, our reasoning shifts from analytical to intuitive, which parallels a reduction in the need for cognitive control. Here, we sought to confirm this claim by employing electroencephalographic (EEG) measures of cognitive control as participants performed a simple perceptual decision-making task. Specifically, we had participants categorize “blobs” into families based on their visual attributes so we could examine how their reasoning changed with learning. In a key manipulation, halfway through the experiment we introduced novel blob families to categorize, thus temporarily increasing the need for analytical reasoning (i.e., cognitive control). Congruent with past research, we focused our EEG analyses on frontal theta activity as it has been linked to cognitive control and analytical thinking. As hypothesized, we found a transition from analytical to intuitive decision-making systems with learning as indexed by a decrease in frontal theta power. Further, when the novel blobs were introduced at the midpoint of the experiment, we found that decisions about these stimuli recruited analytical reasoning as indicated by increased theta power in comparison to decisions about well-practiced stimuli. We propose our findings to reflect prediction errors to decision demands—a monitoring process that determines whether our expectations of demands are met. Shifting from analytical to intuitive reasoning thus reflects the stabilization of our expectations of decision demands, which can be violated with unexpected demands when encountering novel stimuli.",,"Reasoning, Prediction errors, Cognitive control, Theta, EEG"

Research has shown students have difficulty in moving across, connecting, and sensemaking from multiple representations. There is a need to develop task-specific representational competencies for students to reason and conduct scientific investigations using multiple representations. In this study, we focus on three representational competencies: 1) linking between representations, 2) disciplinary sensemaking from multiple representations, and 3) conceptualizing domain-relevant content derived from multiple representations. We developed a block code-based computational modeling environment with three different representations and embedded it within an online activity for students to carry out investigations around the earthquake cycle. The three representations include a procedural representation of block codes, a geometric representation of land deformation build-up, and a graphical representation of deformation build-up over time. We examined the extent of students' representational competencies and which competencies are most correlated with students’ future performance in a computationally supported geoscience investigation. Results indicate that a majority of the 431 students showed at least some form of representational competence. However, a relatively small number of students showed sophisticated levels of linking, sensemaking, and conceptualizing from the representations. Five of seven representational competencies, the most prominent being code sensemaking (η2 = 0.053, p < 0.001), were significantly correlated to student performance on a summative geoscience investigation.",,"Teaching/learning strategies, Simulations, Pedagogical issues, Applications in subject areas"

The recently proposed computation-flexible BERT models facilitate their deployment in varied computational environments. Training such flexible BERT models involves jointly optimizing multiple BERT subnets, which will unavoidably interfere with one another. Besides, the performance of large subnets is limited by the performance gap between the smallest subnet and the supernet, despite efforts to enhance the smaller subnets. In this regard, we propose layer-wise Neural grafting to boost BERT subnets, especially the larger ones. The proposed method improves the average performance of the subnets on six GLUE tasks and boosts the supernets on all GLUE tasks and the SQuAD data set. Based on the boosted subnets, we further build an inference framework enabling practical width- and depth-dynamic inference regarding different inputs by combining width-dynamic gating modules and early exit off-ramps in the depth dimension. Experimental results show that the proposed framework achieves a better dynamic inference range than other methods in terms of trading off performance and computational complexity on four GLUE tasks and SQuAD. In particular, our best-tradeoff inference result outperforms other fixed-size models with similar amount of computations. Compared to BERT-Base, the proposed inference framework yields a 1.3-point improvement in the average GLUE score and a 2.2-point increase in the F1 score on SQuAD, while reducing computations by around 45%.",,"Grafting, Dynamic inference, Large Language Models, Deep learning"

In an array of PV modules it is possible to observe multiple peaks in the power versus voltage (P-V) curve due to the current versus voltage (I–V) PV cell mismatch caused by differences in the received irradiance, such as occurs during partial shading. In these circumstances, the ability of the MPPT devices to track the global MPP of the PV array directly influences the system efficiency. In the literature, various MPPT techniques have been proposed. Among them, computational intelligence (CI) algorithm based MPPT methods have demonstrated the ability to find the global MPP. This paper presents a detailed and specific review of CI- based MPPT techniques. Each method type is classified into one of several subcategories according to its application strategy. The various ways of applying CI into MPPTs are analyzed in detail. The advantages and disadvantages of each method are discussed and compared.

Forming concepts, propositions, problems, and directions are examples of thinking. Thinking can be visual, verbal, or abstract. It can be chaotic or orderly, creative, or routine. Thinking of any kind is an activity of some plastic neural systems. Of all mental activities, thinking is probably the one most affected by chemical changes and changes in basic properties of neurons. For example, humans unable to oxidize the amino acid phenylalanine cannot think, thyroid hypofunction produces cretinism, and normal subjects cannot think straight when in states of extreme stress, which are often states of hormonal imbalance, or when under the action of psychotropic drugs. The chapter also discusses the concept of cognition. All cognition is learned but not every learned item is of a cognitive nature. All cognition is cognition of some object, concrete or conceptual, and it consists in some information about its object—complete or partial, true or false.

An information-flow model of an artificial brain mechanism is described whose activity; it is argued is the correlate to activity, such as perceiving, learning, thinking, knowing, etc. This leads finally to a consideration of the impact of these notions on theoretical neurophysiology and its attempt to frame suitable hypotheses and on epistemology that is concerned with the logical analysis of measures, methods, and techniques, which can justify the activity of knowing.",Elsevier,

This opens the door to the design of Monte Carlo codes directly estimating radiative transfer observables from spectroscopic databases. The intermediate step of producing accurate high-resolution absorption spectra is no longer required. A Monte Carlo algorithm is proposed and applied to six one-dimensional test cases.

Based on this definition, we propose a procedure to construct a lightweight qualitative meta-model by the active selection of data instances. We then use a meta-model to carry out the feature selection task. We apply this procedure to the GA-based algorithm CHC (Cross generational elitist selection, Heterogeneous recombination and Cataclysmic mutation) to create a Qualitative approXimations variant, CHCQX. We show that CHCQX converges faster to feature subset solutions of significantly higher accuracy (as compared to CHC), particularly for large datasets with over 100K instances. We also demonstrate the applicability of the thinking behind our approach more broadly to Swarm Intelligence (SI), another branch of the Evolutionary Computation (EC) paradigm with results of PSOQX, a qualitative approximation adaptation of the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) method. A GitHub repository with the complete implementation is available.22https://github.com/Ghaith81/Fast-Genetic-Algorithm-For-Feature-Selection.",,"Feature selection, Evolutionary computation, Genetic Algorithm, Particle Swarm Intelligence, Fitness approximation, Meta-model, Optimization"

In this study, we consider the idle resources of the surrounding parked vehicles (PVs) and roadside units (RSUs) as service providers to enhance the performance of User Equipment (UE). We propose a joint offloading architecture that uses parked vehicles. Additionally, owing to the dynamic and uncertain nature of the environment, we model computation offloading as a dynamic multi-objective optimization problem to simultaneously optimize the latency and energy consumption of UE applications. In this study, we propose a dynamic multi-objective evolutionary algorithm with a multi-strategy fusion response (DMOEA/D-MSFR). Specifically, we introduce a population center positioning strategy and a learnable prediction mechanism using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) in DMOEA-MSFR, which divides the prediction optimization process into two stages and exhibits a rapid response to environmental changes. In the static optimization phase, an adaptive weight vector adjustment strategy is employed, which significantly aids in the distribution and diversity of the solutions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework balances the trade-off between latency and energy consumption, and the convergence, feasibility, and diversity of the non-dominated solutions obtained.",,"Vehicle edge computing, Dynamic multi-objective optimization, Evolutionary algorithms, Computational offloading, Vehicle collaboration"

This impact is likely to accelerate and become even more significant as the computational potential of generative AI grows through training on more diverse and more extensive language models and data sets. Emerging research in this new field suggests that previous models of understanding the interactions between machine and human may no longer be sufficient in a world of generative AI. The significant question is how emerging generative AI technologies will relate to and be a part of human creativity and creative outputs. In this article, we adopt a posthuman stance and conceive of creative output involving generative AI and humans in terms of a yet-to-be-fully-realised and emergent relationship that will likely become more integrated and complex. To investigate and experiment with this relational notion, each of us (as part of an autoethnographic approach) developed a creative output using ChatGPT: a poem and a multimodal narrative. We then employed the idea of alterity relations from the American philosopher of technology, Don Ihde, to conceive of the possibilities and limitations in working relationally and productively with generative AI. As two academics working in teacher education, we applied our learning from this exploration to possibilities in educational contexts. In this article, we offer several important implications and provocations for practitioners, researchers, educators and policymakers, not only in terms of practical concerns but also for rethinking the nature of the creative output.",,"Generative AI, Creative production, Posthumanism, Education, Autoethnography, Alterity relations"

As Michael Speaks wrote in 2002, “if philosophy was the intellectual dominant of early twentieth century vanguards and theory the intellectual dominant of late twentieth century vanguards, then intelligence has become the intellectual dominant of twenty-first century post-vanguards” (Speaks, 2010, p. 211). This emphasis on intelligence fostered a progressive narrative around the increasing reliance on software in design processes. This paper examines architectural practice during this period, with a specific focus on the rise of a new set of values, priorities, and factors that transformed architectural thinking and making. In contrast to existing accounts of digital design’s history, this paper places less importance on outputs and more on the shifts in modes of working and enacting design labor. More specifically, it narrows in on a software application that, as will be argued, drastically changed both cultural values and design knowledge: Rhinoceros. Beyond simply facilitating the production of geometrically intricate and complex architectural assemblies, Rhinoceros helped shape the discourse on parametric, computational, and algorithmic design, redefining the role of the designer as a creative technologist. In doing so, it also engendered a specific community of practice, which in turn produced its own culture and folklore. The spread of this software greatly contributed to the rise of two new kinds of architectural technologists: the “parametric designer” and the “digital fabricator,” two actors who would significantly impact how architecture was imagined and produced from the mid-2000s through the 2010s.",,"Software, History, Parametric design, Digital fabrication, Theory"

How do people generate and interpret the communicative meaning of objects? We hypothesized that this capacity is supported by social goal inference, where observers recover what social goal explains an object being placed in a particular location. To test this idea, we study a category of common ad-hoc communicative objects where a small cost is used to signal avoidance. Using computational modeling, we first show that goal inference from indirect physical evidence can give rise to the ability to use object placement to communicate. We then show that people from the U.S. and the Tsimane’—a farming-foraging group native to the Bolivian Amazon—can infer the communicative meaning of object placement in the absence of a pre-existing convention, and that people’s inferences are quantitatively predicted by our model. Finally, we show evidence that people can store and retrieve this meaning for use in subsequent encounters, revealing a potential mechanism for how ad-hoc communicative objects become quickly conventionalized.

Traditional reductionistic approaches often simplify these conditions into linear cause-and-effect relationships, overlooking the complexity and interconnectedness inherent in psychiatric disorders. Advances in complex systems approaches provide a comprehensive framework to capture and quantify the non-linear and emergent properties of psychiatric disorders. This Personal View emphasises the importance of identifying rules for generative models that govern brain and behaviour over time, which might contribute to personalised assessments and interventions for psychiatric disorders. For instance, mood fluctuations in bipolar disorder can be understood through dynamical systems modelling, which identifies modifiable parameters, such as circadian disruption, that can be addressed through targeted therapies such as light therapy. Similarly, recognition of depression as an emergent property arising from complex interactions highlights the need for integrated treatment strategies that enhance adaptive reactions in the individual. A framework for quantifying multilevel interactions and network dynamics can help researchers and clinicians to understand the interplay between neural circuits, behaviours, and social contexts. Probabilistic models and self-organisation concepts contribute to building concrete dynamical systems models of mental disorders, facilitating early identification of risk states and promoting resilience through adaptive interventions delivered with optimal timing. Embracing these complex systems approaches in psychiatry could capture the true nature of psychiatric disorders as properties of a dynamic complex system and not the manifestation of any lesion or insult. This line of thinking might improve diagnosis and treatment, offering new hope for individuals affected by psychiatric conditions and paving the way for more effective, personalised mental health care.",,

Moreover, scholarly research in the field of smart sustainable cities operates out of the understanding that advances in the underlying knowledge necessitate pursuing multifaceted questions that can only be resolved from the vantage point of interdisciplinarity or transdisciplinarity. Indeed, research problems in this field are inherently too complex to be addressed by single disciplines. The PhD study addressing the topic of smart sustainable city development falls within the broad research field of sustainability transition and sustainability science where ICT is seen as a salient factor given its transformational, disruptive, and synergetic effects as an enabling, integrative, and constitutive technology. In light of this, the approach to the PhD study is of an applied theoretical kind, and its aim is to investigate and analyze how to advance and sustain the contribution of sustainable urban forms to the goals of sustainable development with support of ICT of pervasive computing. This is to primarily create a framework for strategic smart sustainable city development based on scientific principles, theories, and academic disciplines and discourses used to guide urban actors in their practice towards sustainability and analyze its impact. This involves the application of a set of integrative foundational elements drawn from urban planning, urban design, sustainability, sustainable development, sustainability science, data science, computer science, complexity science, systems theory, systems thinking, and ICT. Accordingly, it is deemed of high significance to devise a multidimensional framework consisting of relevant theories and academic disciplines and discourses that underpin the development of smart sustainable cities as a set of future practices. This framework in turn emphasizes the interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary nature and orientation of the topic of smart sustainable cities and thus the relevance of pursuing an interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary approach into studying this topic. Therefore, this paper endeavors to systematize the very complex and dense scientific area of smart sustainable cities in terms of identifying, distilling, and structuring the core dimensions of a foundational framework for smart sustainable city development as a set of future practices. In doing so, it focuses on a number of fundamental theories along with academic disciplines and discourses, with the aim of setting a framework that analytically relates city development, sustainability, and ICT, while emphasizing how and to what extent sustainability and ICT have particularly become influential in city development in modern society. In addition, this paper offers an in–depth interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary discussion covering topics of high relevance to the PhD study and at the heart of the very synergic relationship between the theoretical, disciplinary, and discursive dimensions of the foundational framework underpinning smart sustainable city development. These dimensions thus form the basis for the framework for strategic smart sustainable city development that is under investigation and will be developed based on a backcasting approach to strategic planning. This study provides an important lens through which to understand a set of influential theories and established academic disciplines and discourses with high potential for integration, fusion, and practicality in relation to the practice of smart sustainable city development.",,"Smart sustainable cities, Theories, Academic disciplines, Academic discourses, Multidimensional framework, Interdisciplinarity and transdisciplinarity, Systems thinking, Complexity science, Sustainability, Computing and ICT"

We argue that this approach can help us to conceive sustainable social systems that will thrive in the circumstances of accelerating change. The Living Cognitive Society is explained in terms of its fluid structure, dynamics and the mechanisms at work. We then discuss the disruptive effects of Information and Communication Technologies on the mechanisms at work. We conclude by delineating a major topic for future research – distributed social governance – which focuses on processes of coordination rather than on stable structures within global society.",,"Cognitive system, Living society, Information and communication technologies, Future social governance, Individuation, Cognitive development"

Grand challenges are complex by nature and call for nontrivial solutions whose effects show at the level of society. That is why studying public relations’ contribution to grand challenges requires a macro perspective that accounts for the dynamic interaction between individual, organisational, and system levels in a digital communication environment. This paper offers a new paradigm to analyse organisations’ significant and at times undue impact on grand challenges through public relations. It develops a framework inspired by complex adaptive systems thinking and adopts its ten properties for public relations: emergence, adaptivity, heterogeneous actors, nonlinear effects, feedback mechanisms, self-organisation, phase transitions, networks, scaling, and cooperation. The paper applies the framework to the example of sustainable development. It shows why research on grand challenges requires a holistic perspective and how it can help study digitally born communication phenomena. The proposed complex systems paradigm provides space for critical, social scientific, and interpretative research lines in public relations. Inquiries start from the grand challenge and study the communicative interactions between organisations and other actors from existing theory while accounting for the ten properties of complex adaptive systems.

This study aims to address this issue by integrating machine learning algorithms with EnergyPLAN and EPLANopt, a coupling of EnergyPLAN software and a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm, to expedite the optimization process while maintaining accuracy. By saving computational time, we can increase the number of evaluations, thereby enabling deeper exploration of uncertainty in energy system modelling. Although machine learning models have been widely employed as surrogate models to accelerate optimization problems, their application in energy system modeling at the national scale, while preserving high temporal resolution and extensive sector-coupling, remains scarce. Several machine learning models were evaluated, and an artificial neural network was selected as the most effective surrogate model. The findings demonstrate that incorporating this surrogate model within the optimization process reduces computational time by 64 % compared to the conventional EPLANopt approach, while maintaining an accuracy level close to that obtained by running EPLANopt without the surrogate model.",,"Energy system modelling, Energy scenarios, Energy planning, Machine learning"

These puzzles include multiple balanced collections of objects whose weights must be determined by the solver. The arms/beams must be perfectly balanced for it to hang properly. Therefore, they represent, in a pictorial way, systems of equations. Each arm/beam that balances two sets of objects (representing variables as unknown “weights”) represents an equation. The data derived from Grade-6 students who were asked to solve a collection of tasks reflect the presence of the “Puzzling and Persevering” and “Seeking and Using Structure” habits of mind.

One of the major categories of SSL methods, graph-based semi-supervised learning (GBSSL) learns labels of unlabeled data on an adjacency graph, where neighborhood sparse graph is often used to reduce computational complexity. However, the neighborhood size is difficult to set. Instead of assigning a concrete value of neighborhood size, we propose a new label propagation algorithm called multi granularity based label propagation (MGLP) and developed from the view of granular computing. In MGLP, labels of unlabeled data are learned by two classic label propagation processes with diverse neighborhood size k, where granular computing delivers a guiding strategy to leverage multiple level neighborhood information granules, and three-way decision acts as an active learning strategy to select the unlabeled data for further annotating. Through the iterative procedures of label propagating, data annotating and data subset updating, the ultimate pseudo label accuracy of unlabeled data may be higher. Theoretically, the accuracy of pseudo labels is enhanced in some scenarios. Experimentally, the results of simulation studies on ten benchmark datasets, show that the proposed method MGLP can rise pseudo labels accuracy by 8.6% than LP (label propagation), 6.5% than LNP (linear neighborhood propagation), 6.4% than LPSN (label propagation through sparse neighborhood), 4.5% than Adaptive-NP (adaptive neighborhood propagation) and 4.6% than CRLP (consensus rate-based label propagation).

To capture the dynamic process in which cognitive development unfolds in cultural context, this approach examines the influence of culture on the developing cognitive skills between groups – group level analysis, between the child and socialization agents – dyadic level analysis, at the level of the child – individual level analysis, and within the child – situation level analysis. The temporal level analysis further situates cognitive development in historical time. By utilizing different analytical and methodological strategies, the multi-level analysis approach provides converging evidence for the development of cognitive skills in cultural context. Important challenges in this approach include the development of a “big picture” to guide the investigation, methodological training for research assistants, and difficulties in collecting, managing, and analyzing diverse datasets. I discuss the conceptual and methodological issues by using our work on the development of episodic thinking as an example.",,"Culture, Cognition, Episodic thinking, Memory, Multiple levels of analysis"

These miserly processing tendencies have also been described in developmental samples. The measurement of resistance to miserly information processing has been assessed using several tasks, including ratio bias, belief bias syllogisms, cognitive reflection, and disjunctive thinking tasks. Several of these tasks have been studied in developmental samples, including in the longitudinal study described in this volume. There is evidence to suggest that resistance to miserly information processing is measurable in children and youth. While judgment and decision-making tasks vary in the degree to which override of miserly processing is required, individuals also vary in their ability to resist miserly processing tendencies. Individual differences in resistance to miserly information processing serve as an additional foundation to support rational thinking performance.",Academic Press,"Miserly information processing, Dual process models, Children and youth, Development, Ratio bias, Belief bias syllogisms, Cognitive reflection"

The first one is termed crack-path-field technique and is conceived for the identification of the path of those cracks, or slip-lines, represented by strain-localization based solutions of the material failure problem. The second one is termed strain-injection, and consists of a procedure to insert, during specific stages of the simulation and in selected areas of the domain of analysis, goal oriented specific strain fields via mixed finite element formulations. In the approach, a first injection, of elemental constant strain modes (CSM) in quadrilaterals, is used, in combination of the crack-path-field technique, for obtaining reliable information that anticipates the position of the crack-path. Based on this information, in a subsequent stage, a discontinuous displacement mode (DDM) is efficiently injected, ensuring the required continuity of the crack-path across sides of contiguous elements. Combination of both techniques results in an efficient and robust procedure based on the staggered resolution of the crack-path-field and the mechanical failure problems. It provides the classical advantages of the “intra-elemental” methods for capturing complex propagating displacement discontinuities in coarse meshes, as E-FEM or X-FEM methods, with the non-code-invasive character of the crack-path-field technique. Numerical representative simulations of a wide range of benchmarks, in terms of the type of material and the failure problem, show the broad applicability, accuracy and robustness of the proposed methodology.

Firstly, digital models are created based on design drawings and real-world environments, and then an MR system for the UPN is built by the game engine and the OpenXR platform. Secondly, an IoT cloud platform is built to connect with the MR system based on the API sets and cloud services; the data communication between sensors and MR devices is linked with the Socket method, and the data filtering model is constructed by the Kalman algorithm to realize the information exchange between the field workers and the backend managers. Finally, the National Center for Materials Service Safety at the University of Science and Technology Beijing (NCMS_USTB) is used as the experimental site to test this system, and its underground sewage and rainwater pipeline network are used to simulate the key problems in the operation and maintenance.

FRAM is the best-known Resilience Engineering method with several examples of its application in healthcare available. However, the guidance on how to apply FRAM leaves gaps, and this can be a potential barrier to its adoption and potentially lead to misuse and disappointing results. The article provides a self-reflective analysis of FRAM use cases to provide further methodological guidance for successful application of FRAM to improve patient safety. Five FRAM use cases in a range of healthcare settings are described in a structured way including critical reflection by the original authors of those studies. Individual reflections are synthesised through group discussion to identify lessons for the operationalisation of FRAM in healthcare. Four themes are developed: (1) core characteristics of a FRAM study, (2) flexibility regarding the underlying epistemological paradigm, (3) diversity with respect to the development of interventions, and (4) model complexity. FRAM is a systems analysis method that offers considerable flexibility to accommodate different epistemological positions, ranging from realism to phenomenology. We refer to these as computational FRAM and reflexive FRAM, respectively. Practitioners need to be clear about their analysis aims and their analysis position. Further guidance is needed to support practitioners to tell a convincing and meaningful “system story” through the lens of FRAM.",,"Patient Safety, FRAM, Resilience Engineering, System Safety"

We provide general tools for investigating these issues, using a technique we call the method of approximation. We give the general development of this method, and apply it to obtain 2 theorems. First we connect the discrete operation of linear recursion (basically equivalent to the combination of bounded sums and bounded products) to linear differential equations, thus providing an alternative proof of the result from Campagnolo, Moore and Costa [M.L. Campagnolo, C. Moore and J. F. Costa, An analog characterization of the Grzegorczyk hierarchy, Journal of Complexity 18 (2002) 977–100]. Secondly, we extend this to prove a result similar to that of Bournez and Hainry [O. Bournez and E. Hainry, Elementarily computable functions over the real numbers and R-sub-recursive functions, Theoretical Computer Science 348 (2005) 130–147], providing a function algebra for the real functions computable in elementary time. Their proof involves simulating the operation of a Turing Machine using a function algebra. We avoid this simulation, using a technique we call “lifting,” which allows us to lift the classic result regarding the Kalmar elementary computable functions to a result on the reals. While we do not claim that our result is necessarily an improvement (perhaps just different), we do want to make the point that our two techniques appear readily applicable to other problems of this sort.",,"Computable Analysis, Real Recursive Functions, Elementary Computable"

As a result, the regions adjoining grain boundaries harden at a rate much higher than grain interiors. A phenomenological constitutive equation predicting the effect of grain size on the yield stress of metals is discussed and extended to the nanocrystalline regime. At large grain sizes, it has the Hall–Petch form, and in the nanocrystalline domain the slope gradually decreases until it asymptotically approaches the flow stress of the grain boundaries. The material is envisaged as a composite, comprised of the grain interior, with flow stress σfG, and grain boundary work-hardened layer, with flow stress σfGB. The predictions of this model are compared with experimental measurements over the mono, micro, and nanocrystalline domains. Computational predictions are made of plastic flow as a function of grain size incorporating differences of dislocation accumulation rate in grain-boundary regions and grain interiors. The material is modeled as a monocrystalline core surrounded by a mantle (grain-boundary region) with a high work hardening rate response. This is the first computational plasticity calculation that accounts for grain size effects in a physically-based manner. A discussion of statistically stored and geometrically necessary dislocations in the framework of strain-gradient plasticity is introduced to describe these effects. Grain-boundary sliding in the nanocrystalline regime is predicted from calculations using the Raj–Ashby model and incorporated into the computations; it is shown to predispose the material to shear localization.",,"Nanocrystalline materials, Grain size, Hall–Petch"

We report results from seven studies (N = 6405) jointly supporting three interconnected claims. First, the perceived plausibility of a counterfactual event is predicted by the perceived similarity between the possible world in which the imagined situation is thought to occur and the actual world. Second, when people attend to differences between imagined possible worlds and the actual world, they think of the imagined possible worlds as less similar to the actual world and tend to judge counterfactuals in such worlds as less plausible. Lastly, when people attend to what is identical between imagined possible worlds and the actual world, they think of the imagined possible worlds as more similar to the actual world and tend to judge counterfactuals in such worlds as more plausible.

Such models usually overlook the role of the motor cortex in creative thinking. The framework of embodied or grounded cognition suggests that creative thoughts (e.g. using a shoe as a hammer, improvising a piano solo) are partially served by simulations of motor activity associated with tools and their use. The major hypothesis stemming from the embodied or grounded account is that, while the motor system is used to execute actions, simulations within this system also support higher-order cognition, creativity included. That is, the cognitive process of generating creative output, not just executing it, is deeply embedded in motor processes. Here, we highlight a collection of neuroimaging research that implicates the motor system in generating creative thoughts, including some evidence for its functionally necessary role in generating creative output. Specifically, the grounded or embodied framework suggests that generating creative output may, in part, rely on motor simulations of possible actions, and that these simulations may by partially implemented in the motor regions themselves. In such cases, action simulations (i.e. reactivating or re-using the motor system), do not result in overt action but instead are used to support higher-order cognitive goals like generating creative uses or improvising.",,"Motor system, Creativity, Simulations, Embodied cognition, Grounded cognition, Divergent thinking, Improvisation"

Weber fractions for width and height of both ellipses and rectangles were in the range 5–10%, but for area they were higher (10–20%) than predicted from the combination of noisy width and height decisions. With ellipses, observers were more likely to overestimate width or height when the other dimension differed from the standard in the same direction (e.g. both greater). We conclude that observers have no access to high-precision codes for 2-D area, and that they base their decisions on a variety of heuristics derived from 1-D codes.

Students’ expression of visual fluency in the course of making sense of the eigenvalue problem Au=λu associated with a variety of matrices occurred in different, yet not necessarily hierarchical modes of visualizations that differed from matrix to matrix: (i) synthetic/analytic mode manifested in the process of detecting eigenvectors when the sought eigenvector and the matrix-applied product vector were aligned in the same/opposite directions; (ii) analytic arithmetic mode manifested in the case of singular matrices (in the determination of the zero eigenvalue) and invertible matrices with nonreal eigenvalues; (iii) analytic structural mode, though rarely occurred, manifested in making sense of the trajectory (circle, ellipse, line segment) of the matrix-applied product vector and relating trajectory behavior to matrix type. While the connection between the thinking modes (Sierpinska, 2000) and the concreteness–necessity–generalizability triad (Harel, 2000) was not sharp, math majors still frequently implemented the CNG principles, which proved facilitatory tools in the evolution of students’ thinking about the eigenvalue–eigenvector relationships.",,"Undergraduate mathematics education, Dynamic geometry software, Visualization, Representation, Connection, Linear algebra, Eigenvectors, Eigenvalues, Matrices"

Extensive research has identified a positive connection between creativity and bi-/multilingualism mainly in contexts where two languages or more concur in daily communicative interactions. Yet, creativity has received scant attention in regard to L2 (second or foreign language) acquisition that mainly takes place in classroom situations. The scarce research points to a positive relationship between creativity and L2 fluency – understood as the number of words produced. We apply computational network science analysis and Forward Flow methods to examine lexical organization patterns of a low creativity (LC) and high creativity (HC) group of 12th grade Spanish English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learners. The participants completed two fluency tasks, where they generated animal names in their L2, and also L1 – used here as a control measure. EFL proficiency was controlled. Our analyses revealed that the HC individuals were more fluent in L1 and L2, generated more remote responses, and exhibited a more flexible and efficiently structured semantic memory in both languages, with a greater effect of creativity in L2. Contrary to previous research, the L2 semantic memory network exhibited a less random organization. Differences in the L2 learning conditions are adduced as likely causes of this result.",,"Creativity, Semantic network, L2, Bilingualism, Semantic fluency"

CHAP,Chapter 1 - Object-oriented basis of artificial intelligence methodologies,"Yeturu, Kalidas",2023,https://doi.org/10.1016/bs.host.2023.06.001,Artificial Intelligence,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169716123000251,"If O2 is for I, then what is O2 for AI? What is oxygen for humans is what is object-oriented thinking for artificial intelligent systems. Much the same way as humans need O2 knowingly or unknowingly, the first step in designing an AI system requires the application of object-oriented principles either explicitly or implicitly. The basis of the definition of state in AI is a description of the concept of interest as an object with properties. The idea of an object extends beyond typical noun forms that describe elements of the real world. The verb forms are included as well with -able suffixes such as runnable, serializable, and executable. In the software world, the first step in modeling a business requirement is the identification of objects of interest and defining their properties and interactions. For instance, in the case of web services, a service is an object; in the case of database systems, a table or a transaction is an object; or in the case of large-scale integration, electronic components are objects. The concept of an object extends beyond the software realm and into the mathematical world in an implicit form. Functional analysis is an old topic in mathematics where each function is an object indeed. The concept of space in mathematics relates closely to the possible value ranges of all attributes of an object. Mathematical operators are the same as methods of objects. It is day-to-day practical life in any modern operating system software dealing with process objects and applications such as Python scripts involving function objects. In this chapter, the application of object-oriented thinking to convert a business requirement to a machine learning (ML) formulation is presented with examples. The five steps of supervised ML formulation based on vector representations of input and output, mapping function, loss function, and data set are clarified. The scope and limitation of ML formulation as against general AI methodology are discussed to demystify popular myths. This chapter also reveals the secret behind the success of deep learning methodology as automatic differentiation involving function objects.",Elsevier,"Object oriented, Vector representation, Induction, Deduction, Machine learning, Artificial intelligence"
JOUR,Actor–critic models of the basal ganglia: new anatomical and computational perspectives,"Joel, Daphna, Niv, Yael, Ruppin, Eytan",2002,https://doi.org/10.1016/S0893-6080(02)00047-3,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608002000473,"A large number of computational models of information processing in the basal ganglia have been developed in recent years. Prominent in these are actor–critic models of basal ganglia functioning, which build on the strong resemblance between dopamine neuron activity and the temporal difference prediction error signal in the critic, and between dopamine-dependent long-term synaptic plasticity in the striatum and learning guided by a prediction error signal in the actor. We selectively review several actor–critic models of the basal ganglia with an emphasis on two important aspects: the way in which models of the critic reproduce the temporal dynamics of dopamine firing, and the extent to which models of the actor take into account known basal ganglia anatomy and physiology. To complement the efforts to relate basal ganglia mechanisms to reinforcement learning (RL), we introduce an alternative approach to modeling a critic network, which uses Evolutionary Computation techniques to ‘evolve’ an optimal RL mechanism, and relate the evolved mechanism to the basic model of the critic. We conclude our discussion of models of the critic by a critical discussion of the anatomical plausibility of implementations of a critic in basal ganglia circuitry, and conclude that such implementations build on assumptions that are inconsistent with the known anatomy of the basal ganglia. We return to the actor component of the actor–critic model, which is usually modeled at the striatal level with very little detail. We describe an alternative model of the basal ganglia which takes into account several important, and previously neglected, anatomical and physiological characteristics of basal ganglia–thalamocortical connectivity and suggests that the basal ganglia performs reinforcement-biased dimensionality reduction of cortical inputs. We further suggest that since such selective encoding may bias the representation at the level of the frontal cortex towards the selection of rewarded plans and actions, the reinforcement-driven dimensionality reduction framework may serve as a basis for basal ganglia actor models. We conclude with a short discussion of the dual role of the dopamine signal in RL and in behavioral switching.",,"Basal ganglia, Dopamine, Reinforcement learning, Actor–critic, Dimensionality reduction, Evolutionary computation, Behavioral switching, Striosomes/patches"

We model the application as a task graph which we call a compact MD graph. Such a modeling allows existing mapping heuristics to be applied to this problem. We then provide a parallel algorithm for this application, by using an efficient mapping heuristic called Allocation By Recursive Mincut (ARM) to map the compact MD graph to a hypercube connected parallel computer, the nCUBE 2S. A canonical model for executing parallel computations modeled as graphs is described. Thus, we attempt to provide the missing link between the mapping research and application implementation research, and demonstrate that the execution time can be sufficiently reduced by considering formal mapping techniques, while designing parallel programs for important applications.",,"Mapping problem, Recursive mincut, Molecular dynamics, Compact MD graph, Hypercube"

Robotics seems to contribute to that. Therefore, this study focuses on kindergarten and explores the current research trends regarding children's development of these skills via robotics. It aims to a) construct links between the main factors in the existing research, b) map the related field, and identify gaps to enhance our understanding. In this context, a bibliometric analysis using the Bibliometrix package and CiteSpace and a content analysis utilizing the Atlas.ti Software is employed covering 203 of 3822 studies conducted between 2014 and December 2024. Based on the findings, the most frequently examined topics are social-anthropomorphic robots, human-robot interaction, and computational thinking under the umbrella of educational robotics and skills development. The highest publication performance belongs to the USA, Italy, Japan, China, and Greece. The strongest sources are ACM, IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction, the Education and Information Technologies Journal, the International Journal of Child-Computer Interaction, and the Computers and Education Journal. Besides, Papert, Wing, and Bers arise as the most influential authors. Furthermore, most studies explore one or two C-skills, examining critical thinking the most and creativity the least during interventions focused on several domains but rarely on skills promotion. Moreover, most researchers choose the qualitative method, using small sample sizes, wheeled, floor robots, and various learning theories in short-term interventions. Finally, robots are utilized as assistive instruction kits, teammates, and educators’ assistants while children act as researchers-constructors.",,"Kindergarten, communication, collaboration, critical thinking, creativity, bibliometric analysis, content analysis"
